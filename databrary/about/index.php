		Most developmental scientists rely on video recordings to capture the complexity and richness of behavior. However, researchers rarely share video data, and this has impeded scientific progress. By creating the cyber-infrastructure and community to enable open video sharing, the Databrary project aims to facilitate deeper, richer, and broader understanding of behavior.
		</p><p> 
		The Databrary project includes:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>
		<a href="/">Databrary</a>. A web-based repository for open sharing and preservation of video data and associated metadata.
		</li><li> 
		<a href="http://datavyu.org">Datavyu</a>. A free, open source video-coding software, that enables coding, exploring, and analyzing video data.
		</li><li> 
		<a href="http://labnanny.org">Labnanny</a>. A data management system that supports data-sharing within labs, among collaborators, and in the Databrary repository.
		</li></ul> 
		<p>
		The Databrary project is dedicated to transforming the culture of developmental science by building a community of researchers committed to open video data sharing, training a new generation of developmental scientists and empowering them with an unprecedented set of tools for discovery, and raising the profile of behavioral science by  bolstering interest in and support for scientific research among the general public.</p>

		<h2>Values</h2>

		<p>Databrary aims to increase openness in scientific research. We seek to enable researchers to share their findings with other scientists and the community at-large while protecting the privacy of individuals who participate in research. Participants and others depicted in recordings have the right to consent to having the recordings shared with Databrary. Their wishes must be respected.</p> 

		<p>Achieving these goals requires that we create and maintain a community that embodies the highest ethical standards.</p>

		<h2>Procedures</h2>

		<p>Databrary is governed by a set of <a href="/pdf/sops-2013-04-09.pdf" target="_blank">standard operating procedures</a> (SOPs). Individuals who wish to have full access must apply for authorized Investigator or Affiliate Investigator status. Only researchers who demonstrate knowledge of the principles of research ethics with human participants and who agree to the provisions of Databrary's <a href="/pdf/investigator-agmt-2013-04-05.pdf" target="_blank">Investigator Agreement</a> will be granted access.</p>
		<p>Databrary will begin accepting applications for Investigator or Affiliate Investigator status later this year. The following documents may be useful to researchers considering whether to apply or when preparing an application to a research superivision entity (e.g., IRB) for approval to share with Databrary:</p>
