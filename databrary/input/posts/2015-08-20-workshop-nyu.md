Title: Databrary workshop at New York University

## Coding, Sharing, and Reusing Video Data with Databrary

September 18, 2015

12:00-4:30 PM EST

Databrary is holding a free workshop on video data coding, management, sharing, and reuse for researchers in the New York City area. 
This free workshop will teach researchers—from principal investigators to undergraduates—how to exploit the richness inherent in recordings of children’s behavior by coding, reusing, and sharing research videos and how open sharing benefits the original data contributor with increased citations, attention, and fulfillment of federal funding mandates.
Attendees will leave with in-depth understanding about how to code, reuse, and share video data with Datavyu and Databrary.

Lunch and refreshments will be provided. 
The workshop is free, but registration is required as space is limited.

This is the first workshop in a series of regional workshops that will be held over the next year at universities across the country.
