Title: Databrary workshop at Temple University

## Coding, Sharing, and Reusing Video Data with Databrary

November 20, 2015

12:00-4:30 PM EST

Databrary is holding a free workshop on video data coding, management, sharing, and reuse for researchers in the Philadelphia area. 
This free workshop will teach researchers—from principal investigators to undergraduates—how to exploit the richness inherent in 
recordings of children’s behavior by coding, reusing, and sharing research videos and how open sharing benefits the original data contributor with increased citations, attention, and fulfillment of federal funding mandates.
Attendees will leave with in-depth understanding about how to code, reuse, and share video data with Datavyu and Databrary.

Lunch and refreshments will be provided. 
The workshop is free, but registration is required as space is limited.
