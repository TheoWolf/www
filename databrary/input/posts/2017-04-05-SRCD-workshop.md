## Coding, Sharing, and Reusing Video Data with Databrary

Across age, context, and culture, children produce an extraordinary array of behaviors—speech, gestures, visual exploration, facial expressions, motor actions, and social interactions. Video captures much of the richness and complexity of children’s behavior. The Databrary Project provides the software, cyber-infrastructure, and policy framework to enable sharing and repurposing of developmental video data. With Databrary, researchers can find and reuse videos to illustrate phenomena and concepts, verify coding rules, see procedures and methods, and find inspiration. Databrary’s mission is to capitalize on the potential of video and accelerate the pace of discovery in developmental science.

This free workshop will teach researchers—from principal investigators to undergraduates—how to exploit the richness inherent in recordings of children’s behavior by coding, reusing, and sharing research videos. Attendees will also learn how open sharing benefits the original data contributor with increased citations, attention, and fulfillment of federal funding mandates.

With the right tools, video coding can be easy, efficient, and enlightening. Attendees will learn about Datavyu, a free video-coding tool, to mine the richness of their videos. Video is unique from other forms of data in the opportunities it provides for reuse. We will provide examples of how videos can be repurposed to address new questions beyond the scope of the original study.

We have developed a policy framework that enables sharing of video data and addresses concerns about participants’ privacy. Attendees will learn how to amend their IRB protocols and best practices for obtaining participants’ permission to share their video data. Attendees will learn how to use Databrary to manage ongoing studies and to monitor progress in data collection and coding. Databrary also functions as a lab server and a secure backup for data that can be kept private to only collaborators and lab members until it’s ready to be shared. When ready, the contributor can share the study with just the click of a button! Throughout the workshop, attendees will get hands-on experience using Databrary’s functionality and exploring shared data.

Lunch will be provided. 
The workshop is free, but registration is required as space is limited.
