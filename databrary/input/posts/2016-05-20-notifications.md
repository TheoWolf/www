Title: Notifcations release
Category: Release

We've recently released a new notifications feature that will enable you to be notified by email and/or on the site about activities involving your account and your data. Some of the notifications will appear on the site only under the new “bell” icon. Depending on your preferences, you can also receive notifications via email.

If you want to view the list of new notifications and change your delivery preferences, you can click [here](https://databrary.org/profile/edit?page=notifications) and login.

We hope this will keep you more up to date about activity on the site. If you have any feedback, please let us know by emailing feedback@databrary.org.
