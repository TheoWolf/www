Title: Databrary Pre-Conference at the International Conference of Infant Studies 2016
Category: Conferences and Workshops

This free workshop will teach researchers—from principal investigators to undergraduates—how to exploit the richness inherent in children’s behavior by coding, sharing, and reusing research videos. We will show how Datavyu, a free video-coding tool, helps researchers to mine the richness of their videos. With the right tools, video coding can be easy, efficient, and enlightening. We will provide case study examples of how videos have been reused to address new questions beyond the scope of the original study or outside the purview of the original researchers.

Videos are valuable to other researchers and capable of yielding new insights into the causes and consequences of learning and development. Thus, we will urge attendees to consider openly sharing their videos among a community of like-minded researchers. We will describe how our policy framework alleviates concerns about participants’ privacy, how to obtain participants’ permission to share identifiable data and amend their IRB protocols, and how open sharing benefits the original data contributor with increased citations, attention, and prospects for federal funding.

Attendees will learn how to use Databrary to manage their own studies and students, and to monitor progress in data collection and coding. Prior to open sharing, Databrary operates as a free, secure backup and lab server. Lab members and collaborators can easily access videos, which can be uploaded as they are collected. 

Snacks and refreshments will be provided.
