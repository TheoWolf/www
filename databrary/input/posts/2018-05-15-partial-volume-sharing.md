Title: New Default Sharing Option: Volume Overview
Category: release

More options for sharing are now available! You can now choose to share just an overview of your project, for example, if you're finishing up your data collection or if you want funders and reviewers to see what you're working on, but you aren't ready (or able) to share your data. **This is the new default setting.** Of course, you can still opt to share your data as well, or to keep your entire volume private. Databrary is giving you more control over your research dissemination.
