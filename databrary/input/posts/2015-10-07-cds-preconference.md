Category: event
Event: October 9, 2015

Databrary is excited to host a CDS preconference workshop on **Managing, Sharing, and Reusing Video Data in Developmental Science**g at the [2015 meeting](http://meetings.cogdevsoc.org/) of the Cognitive Development Society (CDS) in Columbus, OH. The workshop will be held on Thursday, October 8, 2015 from 1:00 pm - 5:30 pm.

## Topics
This workshop, led by Karen Adolph and Rick Gilmore, will help researchers learn about open video data sharing, address concerns about privacy, ethics, and citation, and implement best practices in video data management and reuse.
Attendees will learn how Databrary can help them to manage their own studies and labs, share their video data with other researchers, and discover video data that can be repurposed for entirely new questions.

The workshop will address social and ethical issues related to open sharing of video data and discuss policies and strategies that allow video data to be shared with other researchers. 
Developmental researchers with firsthand experience of video data reuse will share their experiences of repurposing video data in their own work. 
Attendees will get to explore Databrary's functionality and learn how to get started obtaining informed consent from participants and managing their video data on Databrary.

## Registration
Researchers with wide-ranging levels of experience -- senior and junior faculty, postdocs, doctoral students, and lab staff -- are encouraged to attend and learn about best practices in sharing and reusing video data.
