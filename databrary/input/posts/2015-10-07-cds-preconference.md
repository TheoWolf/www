Databrary is excited to host a CDS preconference workshop on **Managing, Sharing, and Reusing Video Data in Developmental Science** at the [2015 meeting](http://meetings.cogdevsoc.org/) of the Cognitive Development Society (CDS) in Columbus, OH. The workshop will be held on Thursday, October 8, 2015.

## Topics

This workshop, led by Karen Adolph and Rick Gilmore, will discuss how Databrary can help researchers to manage their own studies and labs, share their video data with other authorized researchers, and discover new video data that can be repurposed for entirely novel lines of research.

The workshop will address social and ethical issues related to open sharing of video data, and discuss policies and strategies that enable identifiable data to be shared securely and responsibly among researchers. The preconference organizers and other researchers with firsthand experience reusing video data will provide illustrations of video data reuse in their own research and teaching. Attendees will get to explore Databrary's functionality and learn how to get started obtaining informed consent from participants and managing their video data on Databrary.

## Registration
Researchers with wide-ranging levels of experience -- senior and junior faculty, postdocs, doctoral students, and lab staff -- are encouraged to attend and learn about best practices in sharing and reusing video data. 

Registration is free, but space is limited. Please find detailed information and registration for the preconference [here](https://databrarypreconference.eventbrite.com). The registration deadline is **August 15, 2015.**
