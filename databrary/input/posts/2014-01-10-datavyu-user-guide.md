Category: datavyu

The community clamored for a Datavyu user guide, and we delivered! Check out the [Datavyu User Guide](http://datavyu.org/user-guide/index.html) today to start making the most of this powerful software package.

# What's inside?

The user guide is divided into three sections.

## Software Guide

The *Software Guide* chunks Datavyu's features into bite-sized portions even an undergrad could understand. It also provides a number of tutorials aimed at helping new users go from novice to expert in no time at all.

## Ruby API

The *Ruby API* helps users edit the powerful script library that comes bundled with Datavyu to wrangle complex coding spreadsheets into useable, clean data. We provide just enough detail to allow the brave or intrepid to create their own scripts from scratch.

## Best Practices

The *Best Practices* is a must-read for new and veteran users alike. Drawn from our experience with researchers across the country, this section describes our suggestions for how to quickly and painlessly make the most of both Datavyu and your data.
