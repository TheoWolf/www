## Coding, Sharing, and Reusing Video Data with Databrary

The *free* workshop sponsored by the Databrary project will provide training on easy, efficient, ethically responsible ways of reusing, managing, and sharing video data to meet the federal funding mandates. Researchers at all levels of experience—faculty, postdocs, graduate students, and research staff—will learn valuable skills that can increase the likelihood of federal funding.

The workshop will cover best practices for coding behavior from video, ethical and responsible ways to enable sharing of research videos with other researchers, and the opportunities presented by repurposing shared video data to ask new questions and accelerate the pace of discovery in developmental science. 

Registration is free. Lunch and refreshments will be provided.
