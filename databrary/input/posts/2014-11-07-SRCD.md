Databrary will be at the Biennial Meeting for the [Society for Research in Child Development](http://www.srcd.org/meetings/biennial-meeting/2015-call-submissions) (SRCD) in Philadelphia, March 18-21st, 2015.

We will hold a pre-conference on Wednesday March 18th at the Philadelphia Convention Center. Our pre-conference will have a Datavyu and Databrary workshop with one-on-one training and a Databrary luncheon about sharing video data and a demonstration of our latest features.

We will also have a Databrary and Datavyu booth throughout the conference, with walkthroughs of the site and on-site user support. We hope you will stop by and learn more about Databrary and Datavyu. 
Karen Adolph is also giving an invited talk about coding and sharing video data.

Keep an eye out for our pre-conference registration so you can get more details and participate.
