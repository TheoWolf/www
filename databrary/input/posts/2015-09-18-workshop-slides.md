Title: NYU Workshop Presentation Slides
Event: September 18, 2015

We held our first regional workshop on coding, sharing, reusing video using Databrary and Datavyu on September 18th at NYU. The slides from the presentations are below. 

[Introduction to Databrary: Video reuse & sharing](/files/NYU-workshop-lunch.pdf)

*Video is a powerful medium for capturing the richness of behavior and offers great potential for reuse. Databrary is creating a web-based library for organizing research videos and building a community of researchers committed to sharing and reusing video data. We will show examples of how video data reuse can facilitate developmental research.*

[Policies and best practices for reusing, sharing, and managing video data](/files/NYU-workshop-policies.pdf)

*Special policies are needed to enable secure, responsible sharing of identifiable video data. Databraryâ€™s policy framework enables sharing research videos and metadata through informed consent and institutional authorization of researchers. We will discuss how to obtain consent to share data and become authorized to access shared data, as well as best practices for reusing, sharing, and managing video data using Databrary.*

[Best practices in behavioral video coding and introduction to Datavyu](/files/NYU-workshop-datavyu.pdf)

*We will present best practices in behavioral coding from video data, including the four steps of behavioral video coding and an introduction to the features and functionality of Datavyu, a free, open-source video coding tool.*
