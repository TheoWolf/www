The [rights and responsibilities](|filename|user-guide/responsibilities.md) of researchers (*Authorized Investigators* and their *Affiliates*) and their institutions are detailed below. 

Our [User Guide](|filename|user-guide/guidance.md) contains information for Institutions and researchers about how to access and use Databrary.

Databrary policies are posted in our [policies](|filename|user-guide/policies.md) section.

#Overview

## Guiding ethical principles

Databrary's three guiding ethical principles embody the committment that is expected of all community members to build a community that follows the highest ethical standards.

As a member of the Databrary community you promise to:

1. treat Databrary data with the **same high standard of care** that you treat data collected in your own laboratory.
1. ensure that participants' wishes about sharing their data are respected. 
1. Authorized Investigators must take care in granting and managing access for Affiliates and take responsiblility for their use of Databrary.

## The Databrary Approach

Databrary strives to enable widespread video data sharing while protecting confidentiality and privacy. The Databrary approach consists of several components:

### Asking Permission

If a video or other research data contain identifiable information, researchers must ask participants (or the participant's parent or guardian) for their permission to share this information with other researchers. Only if the participant agrees may videos or identifiable information be shared with other researchers. Databrary provides a template sharing release, similar to a photo release, that researchers may adapt for use in their own laboratories. Participants may choose to not to share at all, share only with other researchers, or allow a short excerpt or clip to be shared with the public for educational or scientific purposes, like a classroom lecture or research presentation.

### Limiting Access to Authorized Individuals

Some participants may give permission to share their videos and research data with the public, but most will not. So, Databrary limits access to individuals who [apply for authorization](|filename|guide/investigators/getting-authorized.md) and receive approval for access on the basis of specific qualifications:

- Affiliation with an institution involved in research or teaching (e.g., a college or university).
- Training in research ethics.
- Authority to conduct independent research.

Applicants must also promise to uphold Databrary's ethical principles, to follow practices that protect the identities of research participants, and to abide by Databrary's policies.

Researchers who meet these qualifications and receive approval from their Institution and Databrary will be given *Authorized Investigator* status. Students and trainees who conduct research under the supervision of an *Authorized Investigator* may be given more limited access privileges as an *Affiliate*.

*Authorized Investigators* or *Affiliates* may access Databrary for educational or non-research purposes. *Authorized Investigators* and *Affiliates* promise to secure approval from their Institution in order to contribute data to or conduct research on data from Databrary. 

### Requiring Institutional Partnerships

Databrary requires that researchers seeking access to restricted information have approval from their home institution. Institutions verify the status of *Authorized Investigators*, supervise the research of *Authorized Investigators*, and take responsibility for the conduct of *Authorized Investigators* who access Databrary.
