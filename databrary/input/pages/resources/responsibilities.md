## Background: Why Databrary data require special care

Video and audio recordings may contain Personally Identifying Information.
Depicted Individuals may be Research Participants or other individuals who are incidentally recorded.
Images and/or voices may be visible or heard and names may be spoken out loud.
If a study takes place in a home or other setting, aspects of that home or setting may be recorded.
Thus, individuals or locations may be identified from Recordings.
Any disclosure of the identity of Research Participants violates the Promise of Confidentiality given to them.
Identification of other individuals depicted in Recordings violates their privacy as well.

De-Identified Data, Non-Identifiable Data, Metadata and Recordings may be combined to identify individuals.
These represent significant risks.

To avoid risks associated with the identification of Depicted Individuals, Authorized Investigators agree to follow the policies in this user guide, and Institutions agree to take responsibility for the Authorized Investigators who they authorize.
