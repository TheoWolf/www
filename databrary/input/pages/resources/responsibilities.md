## Background: Why video requires special care

Video and audio recordings may contain information about research participants or other individuals who are incidentally recorded.
Images and/or voices may be visible or heard and names may be spoken out loud.
If a study takes place in a home or other setting, aspects of that home or setting may be recorded.
Thus, individuals or locations may be identified from recordings. In addition, metadata (e.g. child's birthdate) may contain identifiable information.

To avoid risks associated with the unintended identification of depicted individuals, *authorized investigators* agree to follow the policies in this user guide, and institutions agree to take responsibility for the  investigators who they authorize.
