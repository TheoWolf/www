Title: Contributing Data 
Brief: Contributing
Order: 2210

Databrary encourages *authorized investigators* to share the products of their scientific work including raw video data, video excerpts, behavioral and physiological data, metadata, coding manuals, coding spreadsheets, lab notebooks, analysis code, figures, links to publications resulting from data, manuscripts that are not copyrighted, and other materials.

*affiliates* can share materials only under the auspices of an *authorized investigator*.

## Responsibilities of Data Contributors

*Authorized investigators* must have the right to share with Databrary any data they contribute; no other entity or individual should have ownership rights that prevent an Investigator from contributing data to Databrary.

When contributing *data*, *authorized investigators* agree to:

- Seek, secure, and maintain permission to conduct research from the entity that governs research at the *authorized investigator*'s institution, and faithfully represent to Databrary information about any research approval status if requested.
- Receive approval from the entity that governs research at the institution to ask depicted individuals or their legal parent or guardian for permission to share *data* in Databrary. 
- Ensure that depicted individuals document their wishes about data sharing by signing copies of the appropriate Databrary Release documents or through other equivalent means. 
- Share identifiable information (including [HIPAA]() or other protected data, as appropriate) according to the terms of the participant release.
- For any identifiable information, provide information to Databrary about the *release level* permitted that respects the wishes of *depicted individuals*.
- Exercise professional judgment in determining what to share.

## Rights of Data Contributors

- *Authorized investigators* may, but are not required to contribute data to Databrary.
- *Authorized investigators* may decide whether to share, when to share, and with whom they want to share within the parameters defined by Databrary.
- *Authorized investigators* may share only among members of an approved research protocol, with selected *authorized investigators*, with all *authorized investigators*, or with the public.
- Data will be available based on the level of sharing that *authorized investigators* have chosen, pursuant to Databrary's polices and procedures, and the *release level* granted by Depicted Individuals or Research Participants. 
- By default, all new data that is uploded to Databrary is private, accessible only to the data owner. Private data may be shared with other individuals selected by the data owner such as members of an approved research protocol or other Investigators.
- Even if a dataset or study containing multiple components is shared, only the specific components of the dataset or study that have been designated for sharing with all Databrary *authorized investigators* or the public will be accessible to these individuals. Non-released components will remain exclusively available to the data owner and selected collaborators.
- Databrary agrees to store data regardless of whether it is shared. However, Databrary reserves the right to limit the amount or kind of data that will stored without charge or the level of service provided. 
- Data that have been shared with all Databrary *authorized investigators* or the public may have priority for storage and processing resources.
- *Authorized investigators* may change or revoke at any time the rights other Databrary *authorized investigators* have to access data the Investigator has contributed. However, Databrary cannot guarantee that data previously shared can be retrieved.
