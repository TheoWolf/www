Databrary encourages *authorized investigators* to share the products of their scientific work including raw video data, video excerpts, behavioral and physiological data, metadata, coding manuals, coding spreadsheets, lab notebooks, analysis code, figures, links to publications resulting from data, manuscripts that are not copyrighted, and other materials.

*Affiliates* can share materials only under the auspices of an *authorized investigator*.

## Responsibilities of Data Contributors

*Authorized investigators* must have the right to share with Databrary any data they contribute; no other entity or individual should have ownership rights that prevent an Investigator from contributing data to Databrary. *Authorized investigator*s must obtain the necessary approvals required by their institution for contributing data.

When contributing *data*, *authorized investigators* agree to:

- Seek, secure, and maintain permission to conduct research from the entity that governs research at the *authorized investigator*'s institution, and faithfully represent to Databrary information about any research approval status if requested.
- Receive approval from the entity that governs research at the institution to ask depicted individuals or their legal parent or guardian for permission to share *data* in Databrary. 
- Ensure that depicted individuals document their wishes about data sharing by signing copies of the appropriate Databrary Release documents or through other equivalent means. 
- Share identifiable information (including [HIPAA]() or other protected data, as appropriate) according to the terms of the participant release.
- For any identifiable information, provide information to Databrary about the *release level* permitted that respects the wishes of *depicted individuals*.
- Exercise professional judgment in determining what to share.
