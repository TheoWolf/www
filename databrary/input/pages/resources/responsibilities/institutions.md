Order: 2100

Databrary requires that an applicant for Authorized Investigator status be associated with an Institution.
An official with authority to sign on behalf of the institution and bind the institution must co-sign the [Databrary Access Agreement](|filename|../policies/investigator-agreement.mdi).

## Databrary Access Agreement 

<!--draft language for access and IRB approval not being necessary-->

## Authorizing Investigators

The institution:

- verifies that *Authorized Investigators* are eligible to conduct independent research at the institution.
- validates that *Authorized Investigators* have research ethics training that meets the institution's standards.
- maintains an ethics or institutional Review Board (IRB) or an equivalent entity that oversees the scientific activities of *Authorized Investigators*.
- grants *Authorized Investigators* the responsibility to choose and manage *Affiliates* who meet Databrary's qualifications and who agree to follow Databrary's ethical principles.
The institution holds *Authorized Investigators* responsible for the conduct of *Affiliates* they select.
- grants each *Authorized Investigator* authority to decide when and with whom the *Authorized Investigator* wishes to share data, and the institution holds the *Authorized Investigator* responsible for the use of shared data.
- accepts responsibility for its Authorized Investigator(s) actions related to the use of Databrary.


## Data Contribution and Use

The institution:

-  asserts that it has the rights to share with Databrary any data the Authorized Investigator contributes; no other entity or individual has ownership rights that prevent the Authorized Investigator from contributing data to Databrary.

- agrees to allow use of the data exclusively for the purpose of scientific research or education under the auspices of an academic, research, government, health, or commercial entity (but in the last case, solely for non-commercial purposes unless allowed under the terms of a separate agreement).

- agrees not to sell or trade data or use it for other commercial purposes.

- agrees to follow all relevant national, state, and local laws and regulations that pertain to the use of research data.

## Confidentiality and Ethics

The institution agrees to inform Databrary of any suspected violation of confidentiality or ethics.
If Databrary determines that an *Authorized Investigator* at the institution has violated the terms of the Databrary Access Agreement or other Databrary policies, Databrary may remove the data in question and/or deny the *Authorized Investigator* or the institution access to Databrary, temporarily or permanently.

Any violation may be reported to the official at the institution charged with handling violations of research ethics. 
The Institution may request information from Databrary about the Authorized Investigator's use or their Affiliate's use of the library.

If denied access to Databrary, *Authorized Investigators* or the institution may request a review.
