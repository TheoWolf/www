Title: Respecting Participant Release Levels
Brief: Respecting Release Levels
Order: 5230

People depicted in recordings have the right to consent to having their video and other potentially identifiable data shared with Databrary if they are fully informed of the potential risks of agreeing to share.

## Responsibilities of Authorized Investigators and *Affiliates*

With respect to the release levels, *authorized investigator*s:

- Understand that depicted individuals may grant different levels of release to share their recordings and data with Databrary.

- Must abide by the release levels that participants granted.

- Must exercise professional judgment and uphold ethical principles in determining which *excerpts* to show and to what audiences.
If there is uncertainty about the release level granted by a depicted individual, those *recordings* or *data* must be marked or used with the most conservative release level that can be ascertained with certainty.

- Should minimize the possibility that a depicted individual can be identified, embarrassed, or harmed by the use of an *excerpt* or any other Databrary resources.
