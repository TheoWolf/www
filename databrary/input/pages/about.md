# Overview

The Databrary Project aims to promote data sharing, archiving, and reuse among scientists who study the development of humans and other animals. The project focuses on creating tools for scientists to store, manage, preserve, analyze, and share video and other temporally dense streams of data. The project is based at [New York University](http://www.nyu.edu) and at [Penn State](http://www.psu.edu). The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) have provided funding. 

# Components

The Databrary Project has two main components:

[Databrary](http://databrary.org)
:   A digital data library specialized for storing, managing, preserving, analyzing, and sharing video and other temporally dense streams of data.

[Datavyu](http://datavyu.org)
:   A free, open source software tool for coding, exploring, and analyzing video data and other temporally dense data streams.Databrary is federally funded by the NSF and the NIH to create a library for sharing video and metadata for developmental and behavioral research.
