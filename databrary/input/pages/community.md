Title: The Databrary Community
Brief: Community
Order: 4000

Databrary is made up of a community of developmental and education researchers who use video data as a core component of their research, and who have been authorized by their institution to access Databrary. More information about how to become authorized to access restricted Databrary resources can be obtained [here](|filename|access.md).

# Authorized investigators

View our community of [authorized investigators](https://nyu.databrary.org/party) who have agreed to abide by the [Statement of Rights and Responsibilities ](|filename|access/responsibilities.md)and obtained authorization through their institution to access Databrary data. Authorized investigators can explore data, authorize affiliates, upload data and manage their ongoing studies, post clips or exemplars of their own work, and share their data with other authorized researchers. 

# Authorized institutions

An institution grants *authorized investigator* status by verifying that they agree to the [Rights and Responsibilities of Institutions](|filename|access/responsibilities/institutions.md)  and co-signing their researcher's [Databrary Access Agreement](|filename|access/policies/agreement.mdi).
