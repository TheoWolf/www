#Overview

## What data are shared?

Some Databrary materials are shared with the general public. But, access to most data, especially identifiable or sensitive materials, is limited to people with authorization. 
Sensitive or identifiable data are only shared if (i) participants have given permission for the materials to be shared, and (ii) the researcher who contributed the materials has made them available for sharing.

## How does one access shared data?

Individuals who wish to access or contribute data must [apply for authorization](|filename|user-guide/investigators/getting-authorized.md) as an Authorized Investigator or Affiliate. 
The application must be approved by Databrary and the [Databrary Access Agreement](|filename|user-guide/policies/investigator-agreement.mdi) must be co-signed by the applicant's Institution or sponsoring Authorized Investigator.

## Guiding ethical principles

Databrary's three guiding ethical principles embody the committment that is expected of all community members to build a community that follows the highest ethical standards.

As an Authorized Investigator you promise to:

1. treat Databrary data with the **same high standard of care** that you treat data collected in your own laboratory.
1. take care in authorizing others to access Databrary and take responsiblility for their use of Databrary.
1. ensure that participants' wishes about sharing their data are respected.
