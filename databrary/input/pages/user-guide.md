Title: User Guide
Brief: Resources
Order: 2000

The Databrary User Guide helps to explain the rights and responsibilities of Authorized Investigators and Institutions and how to collect released data that can be shared, upload and manage your own datasets and studies, get authorized and manage affiliates, and explore the data shared in Databrary.

Access to shared data is limited to Authorized Investigators and their Affiliates.
Individuals who wish to have full access to data shared in Databrary must [apply](|filename|getting-authorized/getting-authorized.md) for Authorized Investigator or Affiliate Investigator status.
Users must have their [Databrary Access Agreement](|filename|policies/investigator-agreement.mdi) co-signed by their Institution or Sponsor to become authorized.

All users of Databrary agree to follow Databrary's three guiding ethical principles, which are as follows:

- To treat data taken from or contributed to Databrary with the same high standards of care that one would treat data collected in their own laboratory.
- To take care in authorizing other people (affiliates and collaborators) and take responsiblility for their conduct and use of Databrary data, just as if they were in one's own laboratory.
- To accuraretely and faithfully portray participant release levels correct on any data that is shared and to ensure that participants' wishes are respected in the data they contribute.

Data are only shared if they have been: (a) released by the individual participants for sharing in Databrary and (b) made available for sharing by the contributing researcher.

You can find our [standard operating procedures](|filename|policies/standard-operating-procedures.mdi) (SOPs) and all our other documents in our [Policies](|filename|policies/policies.md) section.
