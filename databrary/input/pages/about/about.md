The Databrary Project aims to promote the sharing of video, flat file data, and metadata associated with developmental and behavioral research. The project has funding from the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and from the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Most developmental scientists rely on video recordings to capture the complexity and richness of behavior. However, researchers rarely share video data, and this has impeded scientific progress. By creating the cyber-infrastructure and community to enable open video sharing, the Databrary project aims to facilitate deeper, richer, and broader understanding of behavior.

The Databrary Project has two main components:

[Databrary](http://databrary.org)
:	A digital data library for sharing, managing, tagging, and preserving videos and associated data and metadata.

[Datavyu](http://datavyu.org)
:	A free, open source video-coding software tool that enables coding, exploring, and analyzing video data.

The Databrary project is dedicated to transforming the culture of developmental science by building a community of researchers committed to open video data sharing, training a new generation of developmental scientists and empowering them with an unprecedented set of tools for discovery, and raising the profile of behavioral science by  bolstering interest in and support for scientific research among the general public.
