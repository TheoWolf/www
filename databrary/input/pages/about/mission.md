Title: Mission
Brief: Mission
Order: 1000

Most developmental scientists rely on video recordings to capture the complexity and richness of behavior. However, researchers rarely share video data, and this has impeded scientific progress. 

Our mission is to promote sharing and reuse of video data.
Enabling reuse of video data is essential to increasing openness, maximizing the efficiency of limited resources, and accelerating the pace of discovery in the developmental and learning sciences. 

We aim to provide tools that encourage good data management, facilitate open data sharing, enable discovery, and foster data reuse and integration.
We are working to build functionality that allows researchers to organize, store, code, and share identifiable video data and other contextual information about the videos with other researchers through a secure web-based library.

<!--# Challenges

Sharing data collected for research purposes poses challenges. Principles of ethics dictate that researchers must promise not to reveal information about who participates in research or what information those participants provide. So, sharing data among researchers must not result in the disclosure of participants' identities or other sensitive information about them.

Sharing video poses additional hurdles. Video often contains information about the identities of people, research participants and bystanders alike. Videos may be altered to make it hard to identify individuals, but this reduces the value of the recordings to others. 

## Principles of Informed Consent Extend to Identifiable Data 
Databrary aims to enable researchers to share their findings with other scientists and the community at-large while protecting the privacy of individuals who participate in research.

By enabling the secure sharing of video and related data, the Databrary Project will enable a deeper, richer, and broader understanding of behavior.-->
