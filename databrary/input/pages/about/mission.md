Brief: Mission
Order: 1000

Most developmental scientists rely on video recordings to capture the complexity and richness of behavior. However, researchers rarely share video data, and this has impeded scientific progress. By creating the cyber-infrastructure and community to enable open video sharing, the Databrary Project aims to facilitate deeper, richer, and broader understanding of behavior.

# Challenges

Sharing data collected for research purposes poses challenges. Principles of ethics dictate that researchers must promise not to reveal information about who participates in research or what information those participants provide. So, sharing data with among researchers must not result in the disclosure of participants' identities or other sensitive information about them.

Sharing video poses additional hurdles. Video often contains information about the identities of people, research participants and bystanders alike. Videos may be altered to make it hard to identify individuals, but this reduces the value of the recordings to others. 

## Principles of Informed Consent Extend to Identifiable Data 
Databrary aims to enable researchers to share their findings with other scientists and the community at-large while protecting the privacy of individuals who participate in research.

## What data are shared?

Some Databrary materials are shared with the general public. But, access to most data, especially identifiable or sensitive materials, is limited to people with authorization. 
Sensitive or identifiable data are only shared if (i) participants have given permission for the materials to be shared, and (ii) the researcher who contributed the materials has made them available for sharing.

## How does one access shared data?

Individuals who wish to access or contribute data must [apply for authorization](|filename|user-guide/investigators/getting-authorized.md) as an *authorized investigator* or *affiliate*. 
The application must be approved by Databrary. The [Databrary Access Agreement](|filename|user-guide/policies/investigator-agreement.mdi) must be signed by both the *authorized investigator* and the Institution; Affiliates must be sponsored by an *authorized investigator*.

# Ultimate goal

By enabling the secure, principled sharing of video and related data, the Databrary Project will enable a deeper, richer, and broader understanding of behavior.
