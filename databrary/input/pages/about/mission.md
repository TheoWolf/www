# The Databrary Project

The Databrary Project aims to promote data sharing, archiving, and reuse among scientists who study the development of humans and other animals. The project focuses on creating tools for scientists to store, manage, preserve, analyze, and share video and other temporally dense streams of data. The project is based at [New York University](http://www.nyu.edu) and at [Penn State](http://www.psu.edu). The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) have provided funding. 

# Components

The Databrary Project has two main components:

[Databrary](http://databrary.org)
:   A digital data library specialized for storing, managing, preserving, analyzing, and sharing video and other temporally dense streams of data.

[Datavyu](http://datavyu.org)
:   A free, open source software tool for coding, exploring, and analyzing video data and other temporally dense data streams.

# Challenges

Sharing data collected for research purposes poses challenges. Principles of ethics dictate that researchers must promise not to reveal information about who participates in research or what information those participants provide. So, sharing data with among researchers must not result in the disclosure of participants' identities or other sensitive information about them.

Sharing video poses additional hurdles. Video often contains information about the identities of people, research participants and bystanders alike. Videos may be altered to make it hard to identify individuals, but this reduces the value of the recordings to others. 

# The Databrary Approach

Databrary strives to enable widespread video data sharing while protecting confidentiality and privacy. The Databrary approach consists of several components:

## Asking Permission

If a video or other research data contain identifiable information, researchers must ask participants (or the participant's parent or guardian) for their permission to share this information with other researchers. Only if the participant agrees may videos or identifiable information be shared with other researchers. Databrary provides a template sharing release, similar to a photo release, that researchers may adapt for use in their own laboratories. Participants may choose to not to share at all, share only with other researchers, or allow a short excerpt or clip to be shared with the public for educational or scientific purposes, like a classroom lecture or research presentation.

## Limiting Access to Authorized Individuals

Some participants may give permission to share their videos and research data with the public, but most will not. So, Databrary limits access to individuals who [apply for authorization](access-agreement.md) and receive approval for access on the basis of specific qualifications:

- Affiliation with an institution involved in research or teaching (e.g., a college or university).
- Training in research ethics.
- Authority to conduct independent research.

Applicants must also promise to uphold Databrary's ethical principles, to follow practices that protect the identities of research participants, and to abide by Databrary's policies.

Researchers who meet these qualifications and receive approval from their Institution and Databrary will be given *Authorized Investigator* status. Students and trainees who conduct research under the supervision of an *Authorized Investigator* may be given more limited access privileges as an *Affiliate*.

*Authorized Investigators* or *Affiliates* may access Databrary for educational or non-research purposes. *Authorized Investigators* and *Affiliates* promise to secure approval from their Institution in order to contribute data to or conduct research on data from Databrary. 

## Requiring Institutional Partnerships

Databrary requires that researchers seeking access to restricted information have approval from their home institution. Institutions verify the status of *Authorized Investigators*, supervise the research of *Authorized Investigators*, and take responsibility for the conduct of *Authorized Investigators* who access Databrary.

# Ultimate goal

By enabling the secure, principled sharing of video and related data, the Databrary Project will enable a deeper, richer, and broader understanding of behavior.
