	<h2>What is Databrary?</h2>

	<div>
		<p>Databrary is a data library for scientists to share video and audio recordings, research data and analytical tools, and metadata with other investigators. In cases where participants give appropriate permission or there is no concern about violating privacy, the general public may also view information in Databrary.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section class="question">
	<h2>Why should I contribute my data or tools to an open data sharing library?</h2>

	<div>
		<p>A history of data sharing and a plan to commit data to an open share will enhance the likelihood of funding. Federal funding agencies and private foundations are now requesting data management and data sharing plans. Your work will receive more citations. Users will cite your data set or tools and the papers associated with them.</p>
		<p>The more investigators who share and the more information they share, the more the community of researchers will benefit, the more scientists will discover, and the more the public will benefit.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section class="question">
	<h2>Will I receive credit for my contributions if other researchers use my data?</h2>

	<div>
		<p>Yes. Users will sign an agreement stating that they will acknowledge contributors by citing any data or tool they use from Databrary. Databrary will provide permanent links and a citation format.</p>
		<p>Databrary will also keep track of the number of times your personal, lab, and project pages are viewed, the number of times your data are viewed, downloaded, or excerpted. These measures of your
		scholarly impact will be reported to you.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section class="question">
	<h2>What can I contribute?</h2>

	<div>
		<p>Data contributors can share raw digital video files, other data streams (e.g., audio, motion tracking, eye tracking coordinates, physiological data, transcripts), papers based on the data, associated metadata (e.g., coded spreadsheets, codebooks, questionnaires, instruments, analysis spreadsheets), and a handful of tags describing the overall dataset that reflect standard federal guidelines (number of participants at various ages and their sex, race, ethnicity, and geographical region, typically/atypically developing) and study design (human/animal, naturalistic/experimental, cross-sectional/longitudinal). These rich forms of metadata will help users to search for appropriate datasets within Databrary, browse the videos within datasets for particulars, and make greater use of datasets for research and teaching.</p>
		<p>Because video and audio recordings and photographs may depict faces, voices, names, or other personally identifying information (see <a href='/user-guide/policies/definitions.html'>Databrary definitions</a>), special care must be taken. The people depicted must give explicit permission for the recordings or photographs to be shared with Databrary. Databrary has created <a href="/user-guide/policies/release-template.html">template documents</a> for this purpose </p>
		<p>In other data formats such as text files and spreadsheets, participants must be denoted by code number not names. Personally identifying information must be removed before data are deposited. Databrary recommends investigators adopt <a href='/user-guide/policies/best-practices.html'>
			best practices for data security</a>
			and uphold the <a href='/user-guide/policies/bill-of-rights.html' target='_blank'>
				Databrary Bill of Rights</a>.</p>
		<p>Tool contributors can share tools and algorithms for visualizing, exploring, and analyzing data, and other uses. Links and scripts will enable interoperability between coded data and tools. Open source tools can share the source code.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section class="question">
	<h2>What about privacy?</h2>

	<div>
		<p>Databrary takes privacy very seriously, but we also believe in the principle of informed consent. We believe that many people who participate in scientific research will give permission for their data to be shared if they can be confident that their privacy and dignity will be respected. Databrary has designed policies and systems to ensure this happens.</p>
		<p>At the end of a research study, people depicted in video and audio recordings and photographs will be asked for their permission to share with other investigators. They can choose whether to share or not and whether investigators can show excerpts from their recordings to the public. No one is coerced to say yes.</p>
		</p>Investigators who have recordings they are permitted to share must be authorized by Databrary to have access to the library. Databrary only grants authorized access to individuals who meet certain criteria and who agree to follow Databrary's policies. The investigators must also
		<ul>
			<li>show that they are knowledgeable about ethical research principles with human participants;</li>
			<li>show that their scientific activity is supervised by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) or its equivalent;</li>
			<li>promise to care for information they view in Databrary with the same care they would treat information they collect in their own labs;</li>
			<li>get official approval from their university or institute before sharing data with Databrary or before conducting research on information within Databrary.
			</ul>
		</p>
	</div>

<section class="question">
	<h2>How do I apply for access?</h2>

	<div>
		<p>You may browse Databrary's public assets freely without signing in. If you wish to have access to protected information, you must submit an <a href="/user-guide/policies/investigator-agreement.html">application</a> for approval as either an Investigator or Affiliate Investigator. Investigators must have Principal Investigator (PI) status at their home institutions. Affiliate Investigators must be affiliated with a Databrary-approved Investigator who sponsors and agrees to supervise the Affiliate Investigator's research. </p>
		<p>The application will request information about you, your institution, and for Affiliate Investigators, the name of the sponsoring or supervising Investigator. You will need to provide information about your research ethics training status. You will also be asked to sign an Investigator Agreement in which you promise to follow Databrary policies and ethical principles when viewing, analyzing, or contributing to Databrary. You will need to promise that you have authority to sign on behalf of your institution or get an official with appropriate authority to sign.</p>
		<p>Databrary staff will review the application, request more information if needed, and when all information is in order, send you an email with login information that grants you access. You will need to renew your account at least every other year.</p>

<section class="question">
	<h2>What are some ways I might use it?</h2>

	<div>
		<p>Consistent with NIH guidelines on data sharing, researchers can:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Upload their own video data and metadata for sharing and archival storage so that their data will survive in usable form beyond their lifetimes</li>

			<li>Enhance teaching by extracting video clips that illustrate an empirical or theoretical point and showing it to their students</li>

			<li>Point readers and reviewers to excerpts (or, if authorized, to raw video data) that illustrate procedures and findings</li>

			<li>View archived data for exemplars to make comparisons with their own work and reinforce open scientific inquiry by checking how coding was done, seeing what displays or apparatuses were used, and gathering detailed information to understand better how conclusions were drawn</li>

			<li>Browse the database to stimulate ideas that lead to further research</li>

			<li>Expand their own sample sizes, run replication studies, examine cohort effects, and assess possible differences due to geographical location or population by using suitable data in the archive</li>

			<li>Integrate data across archived studies to create new datasets or to conduct meta-analyses on raw data or metadata</li>

			<li>Build on other researchers' codes and prior coding efforts to extend or transform prior analyses and promote further discovery and return the results to the archive</li>

			<li>Score archived data for behaviors that were outside the scope of the original study and then return the results to the archive</li>

			<li>Use the video data themselves as stimuli in new studies</li>

			<li>Use archived data for new purposes in fields outside developmental psychology</li>

			<li>Use archived data to test the performance of visualization, exploration, and analysis tools</li>

			<li>Use various tools contributed to the archive to enhance understanding of their own data</li>

			<li>Collaborate with like-minded researchers in a sub-area of development to create corpora of data with shared coding schemes and other metadata, as exemplified by TalkBank</li>
		</ul>

<section class="question">
	<h2>When do I contribute?</h2>

	<div>
		<p>Data contributors can upload data at any point and release it openly at any point - as data are collected, after scoring the data, after manuscript submission, when a manuscript goes to press, or later.</p>

		<p>Funding agency requirements and journal standards about data sharing are evolving. Databrary's <a href="/user-guide/policies/data-sharing-manifesto.html">Data Sharing Manifesto</a> discusses our views on these issues.</p>

		<p>Tool contributors can share their stuff and release it at any point - as the tools are being developed, after testing, after a manuscript goes to press, or later.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section class="question">
	<h2>How can I search the database?</h2>

	<div>
		<p>To search for appropriate datasets or videos, users type in relevant words or phrases (e.g., infant, Smith, language, 12-month-old, 2011). If these words are present in the abstract, manuscript, coding manual, spreadsheets, or other associated metadata, then studies, video clips, or portions of video clips will be returned.</p>

		<p>To navigate within datasets and search results, users could browse by relevance, time sample, or event sample.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section class="question">
	<h2>Do I have to use <a href="http://datavyu.org">Datavyu</a> to contribute?</h2>

	<div>
		<p>No. Contributors are not required to score their data with the Datavyu coding tool. However, we encourage them to use Datavyu because it is free and open source and every user strengthens and grows the community.</p>

		<p>We will work towards round trip interoperability between Datavyu and other free or low-cost academic tools (OpenSHAPA, TalkBank, Elan, Transana). We are also aiming to build one-way translation between commercial tools (e.g., Noldus, Mangold) and Datavyu.</p>
