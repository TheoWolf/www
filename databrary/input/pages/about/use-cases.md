There are many ways to use Databrary. With it, researchers may:

## Preserve
- Upload their own video data and metadata for sharing and archival storage so that their data will survive in usable form beyond their lifetimes.

## Inform
- Enhance teaching by extracting video clips that illustrate an empirical or theoretical point and showing it to their students.
- Point readers and reviewers to excerpts (or, if authorized, to raw video data) that illustrate procedures and findings.

## Draw inspiration
- View archived data for exemplars to make comparisons with their own work and reinforce open scientific inquiry by checking how coding was done, seeing what displays or apparatuses were used, and gathering detailed information to understand better how conclusions were drawn.
- Browse the database to stimulate ideas that lead to further research.

## Conduct New Research
- Expand their own sample sizes, run replication studies, examine cohort effects, and assess possible differences due to geographical location or population by using suitable data in the archive.
- Integrate data across archived studies to create new datasets or to conduct meta-analyses on raw data or metadata.
- Build on other researchers' codes and prior coding efforts to extend or transform prior analyses, promote further discovery, and return the results to the archive.
- Score archived data for behaviors that were outside the scope of the original study and then return the results to the archive.
- Use archived data for new purposes in fields outside developmental psychology.

## Build and Test Tools
- Use archived data to test the performance of visualization, exploration, and analysis tools.
- Use various tools contributed to the archive to enhance understanding of their own data.

## Collaborate
- Collaborate with like-minded researchers in another area of development to create corpora of data with shared coding schemes and other metadata.
- Comment on datasets shared by others; add tags to help others mine datasets.
