Databrary is a first-of-its-kind web-based data library where scientists who collect and analyze video can store and share their data openly with other researchers.
The project is based at New York University and Penn State.
It has grant support from the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
The overall goal is to accelerate the pace of discovery, improve scientific transparency and accountability, and transform research practices in psychology and developmental science.

We are growing a team to design and build new open source solutions for science using the latest technologies.

# Web Developer

The Databrary project seeks a motivated and flexible developer to help build a unique web-based data library.
You will work with users and a small group of developers to design and build the front end UI and back end tools to enable behavioral researchers to collaborate, store, explore, and access research datasets in ways not possible with any existing tool.

The ideal candidate will relish the challenge of building a uniquely powerful set of research tools while working on a small team in a diverse and intellectually stimulating academic environment.

## Responsibilities

- Implement dynamic, modular, and responsive web interfaces to organize, present, and manipulate research materials.
- Design, implement, test, and validate JavaScript across browsers and platforms.
- Integrate feedback from UI experts and researchers (users) to identify and prioritize new features.
