Databrary is a web-based video data library where scientists who collect and analyze research video can store and share their data openly with other researchers.
The project is based at New York University and Penn State.
It has grant support from the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
The overall goal is to accelerate the pace of discovery, improve scientific transparency and accountability, and transform research practices in psychology and developmental science.

We are growing a team to design and build new open source solutions for science using the latest technologies.

If want to help build a uniquely powerful set of [open-source](https://github.com/databrary) research tools with a tight-knit team in a diverse and intellectually stimulating environment, contact us!
