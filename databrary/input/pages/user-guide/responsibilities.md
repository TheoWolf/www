Brief: Rights and Responsibilities
Order: 2000

Institutions, Authorized Investigators, and Affiliate Investigators have specific responsibilities in association with Databrary.

## Motivation

Recordings may contain Personally Identifying Information about Depicted Individuals.
These may be Research Participants as well as other individuals who are incidentally recorded or photographed.
Images and/or voices may be visible or heard and names may be spoken out loud.
Images and voices of visitors or other people who are not research participants may be recorded.
If a study takes place in a home or other setting, aspects of that home or setting may be recorded.
Thus, individuals or locations may be identified from Recordings.
Any disclosure of the identity of Research Participants violates the Promise of Confidentiality given to them.
Identification of other individuals depicted in Recordings violates their privacy, as well.

De-Identified Data, Non-Identifiable Data, and Metadata may be combined to identify research participants.
De-Identified Data, Non-Identifiable Data, and Metadata may be combined with Recordings to identify individuals or cause them harm or embarrassment.
These represent significant risks.

Accordingly, in order to avoid risks associated with the identification of individuals depicted in Recordings which could potentially cause harm or embarrassment, Investigators seeking access to Databrary agree to the following commitments when using Databrary and Institutions agree to take responsibility for the Authorized Investigators whom they authorized.
