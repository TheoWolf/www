#Abiding by Participant Release Levels

I understand that Depicted Individuals may grant different levels of Release to Share Recordings and Data with Databrary. Users must abide by the levels of release that participants granted.

Authorized Investigators must exercise professional judgment and uphold ethical principles in determining which Excerpts to show and to what audiences.

When selecting clips or excerpts, users should be expected to minimize the possibility that a Depicted Individual can be identified, embarrassed, or harmed by the use of an Excerpt.

If there is uncertainty about whether a Depicted Individual has granted Permission To Share or Permission to Excerpt, those Recordings or Data must not be shared, viewed, or distributed. 

Any problems or questions should be addressed to ethics@databrary.org.

Authorized Investigators also promise to cite all Excerpts following Databrary citation practices.
