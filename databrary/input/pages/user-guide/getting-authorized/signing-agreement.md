Brief: Completing the Agreement
Slug: user-guide/getting-authorized/agreement
Order: 3110

Applicants must first complete the Databrary registration process:

- Provide Databrary with contact information that verifies their identity.
- Read and agree to the [Databrary Investigator Agreement](|filename|../policies/investigator-agreement.mdi).

To share and access Databrary data, the applicant must also gain authorization by having their agreement co-signed in one of the following ways:

- *Principle Investigators* must obtain approval from an Authorizing Official at their *Institution* (usually from Grants and Contracts or the Sponsored Programs Office).
- *Affiliate Invistigators* must [obtain approval](|filename|managing-affiliates.md) from the *Databrary Principal Investigator* who oversees their research and who has already completed the authorization process.

To complete this process, the applicant's sponsoring investigator (in the case of an *Affiliate Investigator*), institutional official (in the case of a *Databrary Principal Investigator*), or Databrary staff (on the institution's behalf) will verify the applicant's identity and approve their authorization.
