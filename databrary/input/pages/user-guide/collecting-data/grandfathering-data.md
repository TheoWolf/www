# Rationale

Many researchers already seek permission from participants to show clips from recordings for educational and scientific purposes. Some IRBs have determined that the language used in these permission or release forms is equivalent to [Databrary's Release Template](http://databrary.org/user-guide/policies/release-template.html). This means that some data researchers have already collected may be eligible for sharing with Databrary. 

If you already use a video/audio or photo release form and want to find out whether you can share with Databrary, follow the following steps.

# Is your current release "Databrary-equivalent"?

See examples of language other IRBs have deemed equivalent [here](databrary-equivalent-sharing-templates.md). Does your release permit you to show recordings in educational and scientific settings?

# Seek formal permission from your IRB

If your release permits you to show recordings in educational or scientific settings, then you may apply for formal permission from your IRB to share these recordings with Databrary.

# Determine what sharing permission level applies

You will have to determine whether your current release means that recordings can be shared only for research use by other Databrary Investigators or whether excerpts can be shown in educational and scientific contexts. 

# Share data with Databrary

You may create a new dataset or study yourself or contact Databrary (help@databrary.org) for help in doing so. Make sure to identify which files participants have given permission to share and whether the level of permission permits excerpts.
