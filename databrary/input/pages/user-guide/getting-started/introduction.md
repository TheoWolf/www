# Introducing Databrary

Terms in *italics* are defined [here](|filename|../policies/definitions.mdi).

## What is Databrary?

Databrary is a data library intended to foster sharing of information among researchers.
Databrary's focus is video *recordings* of human collected for psychological research, but also stores many other types of data which include *identifiable data*, *de-identified data*, and *non-identifiable data*, only some of which are open to the public.
Since data in the library, such as images of people's faces, is of a sensitive nature and might be used to determine the identity of research participants who have been promised confidentiality, Databrary requires prior authorization for full access and that those granted access to uphold the highest ethical standards.
Individuals with authorized access to Databrary are called *Investigators*.

Databrary is supported by awards from the U.S. National Science Foundation and Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

## Who can access Databrary?

Anyone collecting [sharable research data](|filename|release-instructions.md) will be able to store and organize their data within Databrary after completing the registration process.
However, access to many of Databrary's shared resources is restricted to people who have authorization.
To receive authorization a person must apply and receive approval, usually through their university's Grants and Contracts or Sponsored Programs Office.

### Who qualifies for access?

*Principal Investigators (PI)* at an *Institution* may qualify.
Researchers whose work is overseen by someone who is a *Databrary Principal Investigator* may qualify to be an *Affiliate Investigator*.
Databrary may also authorize a person based on a track record of scientific accomplishment or on the basis of a written reference from someone who is an authorized *Databrary Principal Investigator*.
The *Databrary Principal Investigator* must verify that the applicant's use of *Data* from the library will be strictly for the purpose of legitimate scientific research. 

All applicants must demonstrate that they have passed a human participants ethics training class and remain in good standing with the *Institution* that supervises their ethics training.
Databrary does **not** require applicants to take ethics training again if they have taken it in the past or to pass training at regular intervals unless required to do so by their *Institution*.
If an applicant is authorized to conduct research with human participants at an *Institution*, that satisfies the Databrary requirement.

## How does Databrary grant authorization?

Applicants must first complete the Databrary registration process:
- Provide Databrary with contact information that verifies their identity.
- Agree to the [Databrary Investigator Agreement](|filename|../policies/investigator-agreement.mdi).

To share and access to Databrary data, the applicant must also gain authorization by having their agreement co-signed in one of the following ways:
- *Affiliate Invistigators* must obtain approval from the *Databrary Principal Investigator* who oversees their research and who has already completed the authorization process.
- *Principle Investigators* must obtain approval from an Authorizing Official at their *Institution* (usually from Grants and Contracts or the Sponsored Programs Office).

### Investigator Agreement

Applicants must sign and date the [Databrary Investigator Agreement](|filename|../policies/investigator-agreement.mdi). Applicants for affiliate status must provide the name of the *Databrary Principal Investigator* who will oversee the affiliate's research or who will write a letter of recommendation. 

The application should be signed and dated by an Authorizing Official at the applicant's *Institution*. Once the application is returned to Databrary, staff will make a final determination about an applicant's status and either grant or deny access.
=======
To complete this process, the applicant's sponsoring investigator (in the case of an *Affiliate Investigator*), institutional official (in the case of a *Databrary Principal Investigator*), or Databrary staff (on the institution's behalf) will verify the applicants identity and approve their authorization.

## How is Databrary different from other data archives or repositories?

### The Databrary Investigator Agreement combines data use and data contribution

Many data repositories require that data use agreements be signed prior to access. Most data repositories have a separate agreement associated with data contribution. Databrary has combined these into one agreement. Most behavioral scientists do not currently share data. Databrary seeks to reduce barriers to data sharing to make it the norm, not the exception. Combining data use and contribution into one agreement reduces procedural or administrative barriers to data sharing. This is in keeping with Federal mandates to share research data and emerging practices related to openness in scientific research.

### Video enables use cases that extend beyond research

Unlike many forms of flat-file, text-based *Data*, video is, to a large degree, self-documenting. As a result, we anticipate that most Databrary *Investigators* and *Affiliates* will use Databrary for a variety of pre-research or non-research uses, including viewing videos for methodological details or to find excerpts for teaching or scientific presentations.

In signing the agreement, all *Investigators* promise to seek IRB approval whenever their use of Databrary requires it. But, prior IRB approval need not be required to enter or view Databrary's resources for non-research purposes.

### Databrary contains *Identifiable Data* for which participants have given permission to share

In order to contribute and share *Identifiable Data* with Databrary, *Investigators* must [get approval](|filename|release-instructions.md) from the people from whom the *Data* were collected. Databrary has developed a [Release Template] (|filename|../policies/release-template.mdi) and recommends it be included in any IRB protocol. But, a given *Institution* may deem other release language to provide equivalent protections. 

Importantly, people whose identities might be discovered must have given informed consent in order for their data to be shared with other researchers on Databrary.

Whether *De-identified Data* may be shared with Databrary without seeking explicit permission depends on the *Investigator's* IRB. Some IRBs allow *De-identified Data* to be shared without explicit permission of the person tested.

*Investigators* promise to provide accurate information about whether *data* may be shared or not. *Investigators* must also indicate whether *excerpts* from recordings may be shown in educational or scientific settings.

### Databrary intends to store *Data* indefinitely

Some IRBs encourage researchers to include promises to destroy *Data*, especially recordings, after some fixed time period in order to limit risk to participants. Data destruction is antithetical to data sharing, and Databrary's Template Release language seeks explicit permission to share data indefinitely. Researchers who wish to store *Data* on Databrary should remove data destruction clauses from their informed consent documents for new *Data* and seek IRB guidance about whether archival *Data* can be shared.
