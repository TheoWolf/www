Title: Release Instructions
Brief: Release Instructions
Order: 3100
Slug: user-guide/getting-started/release-instructions

Databrary requires that investigators have approval before sharing data.
Not only must the investigator's IRB approve plans to share with Databrary, but so must research participants, at least in most cases.
Since video and audio recordings and photographs contain personally identifying information (PII), Databrary requires investigators to get permission from the people depicted in these recordings or images before sharing.
The Databrary Release Template is designed to let the people depicted in recordings or photographs give informed consent to release their data for sharing it.

#Using the Databrary Release

## How do I prepare to share with Databrary?

Here's what you should do:

1. Ensure that your IRB protocol(s) enable sharing with Databrary. 	
	- We recommend adapting the [Databrary Release Template](|filename|../policies/release-template.mdi) for use at the local institution. 
	- The language in the Databrary Release is only a template and can be adapted to suit the unique needs of each investigator and/or project, as well as the local IRB policies that govern an investigatorâ€™s research.
1. Double-check your existing protocol and informed consent/assent documents for data destruction clauses.
	- You will  want to review your informed consent documents and remove any data destruction clauses as these inherently conflict with the ability to store and share data. Instead, we recommend saying "Data will be stored indefinitely in a secure library on the internet." 
	- NIH and NSF **do not** require data destruction clauses.
1. Once you have modified your IRB protocol(s), start securing and recording those permissions from participants. 
	- We advise researchers to ask participants for permission to share at the **end** of data collection so that participants have acquired first hand knowledge about the study. This ensures that consent to participate is completely separate from permission to share and eliminates any risk that asking about sharing will affect participation in studies.
1. Prepare recordings for sharing with Databrary, including tagging files with the level of permission for each session. Remove personally identifying information from other data and metadata.
	- You may decide to upload data to Databrary *prior* to sharing it with anyone. In this way, Databrary can act like a lab file server. You can decide later whether you want to share data with researchers who are not part of your approved IRB protocol.
1. Apply for and be granted Principal Investigator or Affiliate Investigator status with Databrary.

Local, state, and national regulations and laws differ, as do the practices of IRBs and their equivalents.

#Common Questions about Sharing Video Data

## How can identifiable data that I collect be shared outside of my lab?

Data can only be shared with other Databrary authorized users if (i) the data are [de-identified](../policies/definitions.html#de-identified-data), or (ii) the data are video or audio recordings or photographs in which the people depicted have given permission for their data to  be shared. 

Many flat-file data sets can be easily de-identified, but de-identifying recordings is complicated, expensive, and diminishes their value to other researchers. 
So, to share recordings without removing personal identifiers, Databrary asks researchers to get permission to share from those people who are depicted in recordings. 
To standardize the process and make it as simple as possible for researchers, we have developed the [Databrary Release Template](|filename|../policies/release-template.mdi) that can be added to IRB protocols and used with participants.

The Databrary Release Template was developed and refined in close consultation with the IRB office at NYU to give Databrary Investigators a standardized way to obtain the necessary permissions to be shared in Databrary. 
The template form is designed to make it as clear and unambiguous as possible to participants about what agreeing to share their data in Databrary will mean.

## When should I share data?

Our philosophy about Data Sharing is embodied in our [Data Sharing Manifesto](|filename|../policies/data-sharing-manifesto.mdi). We believe sharing data will accelerate the pace of discovery and will lead to stronger, more transperent science.

Unless required by journals or funding agenices, you are never required by Databrary to share data if you do not wish to do so. 

Even if you aren't sure you want to share data now, you may want to be ready to share data in the future. Or, maybe you have archival data you would like to share now, but you aren't sure whether you are able to do so. Here are the steps to take. 

## Can I share data I've already collected?

Some investigators already ask research participants for permission to share [recordings](../policies/definitions.html#recordings) with other researchers or to show them for educational or scientific purposes. 
This permission is often acquired by means of a video, audio or photograph release form that is similar to Databrary's. In this case, some recordings that have already been collected might be shared with Databrary.

If you have language that gives you permission to share or show recordings, you may apply to share these data with Databrary if your IRB rules that your release language is equivalent to Databrary's, or that your data require no such release to share.
