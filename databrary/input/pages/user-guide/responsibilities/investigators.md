Title: Investigators
Brief: Investigators
Order: 2200

This section describes the specific rights and responsibilities Authorized and Affiliate Investigators have agreed to follow in association with Databrary.

## Ethical principles
Databrary's three guiding ethical principles embody the committment that is expected of all community members to build a community that follows the highest ethical standards.

Authorized Investigators commit to:

1. treat data taken from or contributed to Databrary with the **same high standard of care** that one would treat data collected in an Investigator's own laboratory.
1. take care in authorizing other Affiliates and collaborators to access Databrary data as well as their own data and to take responsiblility for their use of Databrary.
1. ensure that participants' wishes about whether and how widely identifiable data should be shared are respected, and to portray accurately and faithfully information about those wishes to Databrary.

## Contact information and identity

Investigators will keep current their contact information and other information provided to Databrary.
Investigators agree to renew their status with Databrary as required by Databrary or whenever they change Institutions.

Investigators agree that Databrary will reveal to the public their name, photo, Institutional affiliations, and any other information provided as part of the Investigator's profile.

Investigators agree not to share personal login information (user name and password) with anyone and will keep it secure.

## Communication with home Institution

Investigators will comply with all relevant rules and regulations imposed by their Institution regarding the use of Databrary.
Investigators will consult with the appropriate officials at the ethics or local Institutional Review Board or its equivalent and secure whatever approvals (or waivers) are required for their use of Databrary resources whether for Non-Research or Research purposes. Ethics, Institutional Review Boards or their equivalents may permit Non-Research use of Data without requiring formal review or approval.
 
Investigators will keep officials at their Institution who supervise research informed about their use of Databrary.

Investigators agree that Databrary may share information about an Investigator's use of Databrary with the Investigator's Institution.

Authorized Investigators agree to complete research ethics training that meets the Institution's standards.

## Databrary policies

Investigators agree to use resources from Databrary exclusively for the purpose of scientific research or education under the auspices of either an academic, research, government, health, or a commercial entity (but in the last case, solely for non-commercial purposes).

Investigators agree to follow Databrary's Best Practices in Data Security for any information they draw from Databrary or collect to contribute to Databrary.

Investigators acknowledge that they have read and understood the Databrary Bill of Rights, the Databrary Data Sharing Manifesto, and other Databrary policies.
