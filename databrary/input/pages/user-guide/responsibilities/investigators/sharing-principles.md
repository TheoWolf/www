Title: Respecting Participant Release Levels
Brief: Respecting Release Levels
Order: 2230

Investigators understand that Depicted Individuals may grant different levels of Release to share their recordings and data with Databrary.
Investigators must abide by the levels of release that participants granted.

Investigators must exercise professional judgment and uphold ethical principles in determining which Excerpts to show and to what audiences.

When selecting clips or excerpts, Investigators should minimize the possibility that a Depicted Individual can be identified, embarrassed, or harmed by the use of an Excerpt.

Investigators promise to cite all Excerpts following Databrary citation practices.

If there is uncertainty about whether a Depicted Individual has granted Permission To Share or Permission to Excerpt, those Recordings or Data must not be shared, viewed, or distributed.

Any problems or questions should be addressed to ethics@databrary.org.
