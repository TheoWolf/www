Title: Contributing Data 
Brief: Contributing
Order: 2210

Investigators understand that Databrary encourages them to share as broadly as possible the products of their scientific work, including Metadata, links to publications resulting from Data, coding manuals, coding spreadsheets, lab notebooks, analysis code, figures, manuscripts that are not copyrighted, and other materials.


## Responsibilities of Data Contributors

Investigators agree to exercise professional judgment in determining what Data to share.
When Contributing Data, Authorized Investigators agree to:

- Remove names and other Personally Identifying Information, except for birth dates, from all files that are not Recordings;
- Seek, secure, and maintain permission to conduct Research from the ethics, Institutional Review Board, or equivalent entity that governs research at the Investigator's Institution, and faithfully represent to Databrary information about any research approval status.
- Receive approval to ask Depicted Individuals or their legal parent or guardian for permission to share Data in Databrary. 
- Ensure that Depicted Individuals document their wishes about data sharing by signing copies of the appropriate Databrary Release documents or through other equivalent means. 
- Accurately share with Databrary the level of Sharing Permission given by Depicted Individuals.
- Abide by limitations on Sharing Excerpts of Data with the Public.
- Delete or modify Data I have contributed if requested to do so by Databrary.

Investigators must have the right to share with Databrary any Data they contribute; no other entity or individual should have ownership rights that prevent an Investigator from contributing Data to Databrary.

## Rights of Data Contributors

Investigators may, but are not required to contribute Data to Databrary.

Investigators may decide whether to share, when to share, and with whom they want to share within the parameters defined by Databrary.

Investigators may share only among members of an approved research protocol, with selected Databrary Investigators, with all authorized Databrary Investigators, or with the public.

Data will be available based on the level of sharing that Investigators have chosen, pursuant to Databrary's polices and procedures, and the Release Level granted by Depicted Individuals or Research Participants. 

By default, all new data that is uploded to Databrary is private, accessible only to the data owner. Private data may be shared with other individuals selected by the data owner such as members of an approved research protocol or other Investigators.

Even if a dataset or study containing multiple components is shared, only the specific components of the dataset or study that have been designated for sharing with all Databrary Investigators or the public will be accessible to these individuals. Non-released components will remain exclusively available to the data owner and selected collaborators.

Databrary agrees to store Data regardless of whether it is shared. However, Databrary reserves the right to limit the amount or kind of Data that will stored without charge or the level of service provided. 

Data that have been shared with all Databrary Investigators or the public may have priority for storage and processing resources.

Investigators may change or revoke at any time the rights other Databrary Investigators have to access Data the Investigator has contributed. However, Databrary cannot guarantee that Data previously shared can be retrieved.
