By default, all studies are private when they are first created.
You can create studies and share data peer-to-peer with other users regardless of your authorization status, but you cannot share data openly until you are authorized.

To choose to share, click on the "edit study" button at the top of the study page then navigate to the "access" tab on the bottom right and you will see options for sharing the study and for adding collaborators.

The two options you will see are: 

**Private**: Share only with collaborators selected below.

**Shared**: Share with authorized researchers and selected information with the public.

If you keep the data as private, only you and 'collaborators' or people that you've sepcifically granted access to the study will be allowed to access the data. Collaborators may be people that work in your lab or colleagues that you are conducting a study with. In any case, a collaborator should be someone that would be on your IRB protocol and would be allowed to access the private data. Note that you can only grant collaborator-type access to the full dataset, including 'private' or unshared data. You cannot grant access to only the Databrary-released data through peer-to-peer sharing.
