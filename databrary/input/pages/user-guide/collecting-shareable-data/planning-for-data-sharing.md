Summary here about things a researcher can do while collecting data to make it easier to share on databrary

## Digitization
###* If you collect data digitally
* Be aware of what format you shoot video in. We can find a way convert mostly anything, but it's a good thing to know
* File names
	* Use alphanumeric filenames. Underscores, hyphens and periods are okay
	* Do not use spaces or punctuation that is not a hyphen, underscore or period.
	* Make sure your file name as an extension ().mov .mp4 )

###* If your data in not available digitally
* If you only collect data on tape, or have older data that needs to be converted or your files are corrupted, contact us. We can find a vendor for you to encode your tapes

###* Where are your files stored?
* Are they all in one place? On a hard drive? On a server? 

## Collecting metadata
There is information we would like to have about your data that you probably already collect in your lab. To make the sharing process easier for you, you can combine all the information in one document and you conduct your research. We can help you create a template you can use in your lab to help you manage your data

There may very well be other information you collect that isn't included here that would be valuable for understanding your data. Let us know what information you collect, and we can include that information in databrary

### Information about the session
A session refers to a single visit or observation period. Participants may be observed at multiple sessions (e.g., longitudinal studies) and you should provide information for each session. Multiple participants may be observed at a single session (two siblings observed playing together) and you should provide information for each participant.
	
#### Information we must have
* subject ID
	* Use a non-identifying ID
* dataset name
	* Use descriptive, non-idiosyncratic words to name the the dataset
* test date
	*YYYY-MM-DD
* release level
	* private - The participant(s) did not consent to share their data
	* shared - The participant(s) consented to share their data with the databrary community
	* excerpts - The participant(s) consented to have their data shared with the databrary community and to having excerpts shown to the public for educational and research purposes
	* public - The participant(s) consented to have their data shared with the world at large
	* no consent information - The default if no consent level information is provided will be private.
	
#### Other information you may already collect 
* exclusion
	* Was this session excluded from the final study? Why? 
* setting
	* In what kind of environment did the session take place?
* country
	* In what country did the session take place?
* state
	* In what state did the session take place
* condition
	* Did the dataset have between-subject conditions that hold for the entire data set? Please use descriptive labels
* group
	* Did the dataset have between-subject groups that hold for the entire dataset? Please use descriptive labels
	
### Information about the participant
A participant refers to a single person contributing data to a single dataset. Participants can be in multiple sessions (longitudinal datasets). But if the participant is in a different dataset, then he/she should be identified with a new participant id associated with that 
dataset.

#### Information we must have
* birthday
	*YYYY-MM-DD

#### Other information you may already collect
* gender
	* male
	* female
* race
	* White
	* Asian
	* Black
	* Multiple
	* Pacific Islander
	* Native American
* ethnicity
	* Not Hispanic or Latino
	* Hispanic or Latino
* typical development/disability
	* typical
	* disability. Please define.
* SES
	* high
	* middle
	* low
* language
* term (gestation) for infants
	* Numeric in weeks from last menstrual period
* experience with target behavior
	* onset date in YYYY-MM-DD
