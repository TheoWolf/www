Title: Guidance for Institutions
Brief: Guidance for Institutions
Order: 2900

Databrary is a data library intended to foster sharing of data, specifically video, within developmental science. We are jointly-funded by NSF and NIH. Since video data is inherently identifiable, we require that all users get authorized by their institution to access any of the shared data on Databrary. 

## How is Databrary different from other data archives or repositories?

### The Databrary Investigator Agreement combines data use and data contribution

Many data repositories require that data use agreements be signed prior to access. Most data repositories have a separate agreement associated with data contribution. Databrary has combined these into one agreement. Most behavioral scientists do not currently share data. Databrary seeks to reduce barriers to data sharing to make it the norm, not the exception. Combining data use and contribution into one agreement reduces procedural or administrative barriers to data sharing. This is in keeping with Federal mandates to share research data and emerging practices related to openness in scientific research.

A few things to keep in mind about the Databrary Investigator Agreement:

1. The Databrary agreement is new and perhaps unique in combining both data use and contribution provisions. That is by design, as we have been charged to lower barriers to data sharing, and we think that combining the agreements helps achieve that end.

2. Databrary contains metadata that are not sensitive, de-identified data, and identifiable data (e.g. videos with faces). All identifiable data in the library have been shared with the explicit permission of the people depicted. The Databrary agreement is intended to formalize the obligations by the scientists who will view, browse, download, analyze, or contribute data. Those obligations include not to misuse the information, not to identify the participants, and to seek approval when a specific use case requires it.

3. What kinds of Databrary use cases require a specific IRB protocol is really a local decision. There are many "pre-research" and teaching use cases that may not require IRB approval. 


### Video enables use cases that extend beyond research

Unlike many forms of flat-file, text-based *Data*, video is, to a large degree, self-documenting. As a result, we anticipate that most Databrary *Investigators* and *Affiliates* will use Databrary for a variety of pre-research or non-research uses, including viewing videos for methodological details or to find excerpts for teaching or scientific presentations.

In signing the agreement, all *Investigators* promise to seek IRB approval whenever their use of Databrary requires it. But, prior IRB approval need not be required to enter or view Databrary's resources for non-research purposes.

### Databrary contains *Identifiable Data* for which participants have given permission to share

In order to contribute and share *Identifiable Data* with Databrary, *Investigators* must [get approval](|filename|../releasing-data/releasing-data.md) from the people from whom the *Data* were collected. Databrary has developed a [Release Template](|filename|policies/release-template.mdi) and recommends it be included in any IRB protocol. But, a given *Institution* may deem other release language to provide equivalent protections. 

Importantly, people whose identities might be discovered must have given informed consent in order for their data to be shared with other researchers on Databrary.

Whether *De-identified Data* may be shared with Databrary without seeking explicit permission depends on the *Investigator's* IRB. Some IRBs allow *De-identified Data* to be shared without explicit permission of the person tested.

*Investigators* promise to provide accurate information about whether *data* may be shared or not. *Investigators* must also indicate whether *excerpts* from recordings may be shown in educational or scientific settings.

### Databrary intends to store *Data* indefinitely

Some IRBs encourage researchers to include promises to destroy *Data*, especially recordings, after some fixed time period in order to limit risk to participants. Data destruction is antithetical to data sharing, and Databrary's Template Release language seeks explicit permission to share data indefinitely. Researchers who wish to store *Data* on Databrary should remove data destruction clauses from their informed consent documents for new *Data* and seek IRB guidance about whether archival *Data* can be shared.
