Title: Planning for Data Sharing

There are a few practices we suggest you adopt to make collecting and sharing data with Databrary easier.
We know data sharing is new and it can be hard to keep everything organized.
We expect that that not everything we ask for is collated, organized, or digitized, but we want you to start thinking about the logistics of sharing your data.

# Collecting metadata

We know you already collect a lot of information about your data in your lab, but you might not keep it all in one place.
Think about what kind of information you collect and where you currently record that information.
There are a few pieces of information that are the most critical for us to have: **test date**, **birth date** and **what level of sharing the participant consented to**. Please refer to our [Definitions of Suggested Fields](planning-for-data-sharing/definitions.html) to see the other kinds of information we'd like and how to best report it.

Right now, you may collect some of your information only on paper.
Going forward for sharing, it will be useful to combine your information about sessions and participants electronically in one place.

There may very well be other information you collect that isn't included here that would be valuable for understanding your data.
Let us know what other types of information you collect, and we can include that information in Databrary.


# Files

Besides video files, we also collect other data or analysis files that supplement your data.
These could be images, graphs, stimuli, protocols, blank questionnaires, blank consent forms or any other files you might have that you are willing to share.
Please note if any of your files contain subject data, and if that information is identifying or deidentifed.
Identified information includes any dates (birth dates, test dates, etc.), voices, or faces.
Names, location information more specific than state, or any other contact information should never be included in Databrary.

You may also want to review your file naming conventions, so that it is easy to identify which files are associated with each session.
