## Consenting is not releasing 

The Databrary Release is unique in one important way: it allows researchers to separate consenting to participate from releasing their data for sharing.
We advise introducing the Databrary Release at the end of the session, so that participants know what was recorded and what would be shared. 
By asking about sharing with Databrary at the end, researchers need not worry that participants will choose not to enter a study because they are uncomfortable with sharing their information. 
Participants will also know what was done during the session and thus have a clearer understanding of what they would be agreeing to share. 

Even this is entirely adaptable, as there may be other reasons that asking at the end is undesirable or infeasible. 
The following considerations may apply when choosing when to introduce the Release:

- If the researcher would like to give participants the option to select which part or parts of the session to share, the form could be given at the end of each section. Alternatively, the form could be adapted to allow participants to answer about each section separately at the end of the entire session.
- It might be appropriate to wait to ask about sharing until the end of a longitudinal study, so that asking about sharing doesn't affect the likelihood of attrition. 
- If there are activities or data of a sensitive nature in some portion of the session, the researcher may choose not to share that portion of the sessions. In this case, researchers may prefer to adapt the form to indicate that the sensitive portion will not be shared.
  	- Remember, the contributor can always choose not to share certain parts of the video even if the participant agreed to share them.
- There may be some cases where it is simpler or necessary to offer the Databrary Release at the beginning of the study (e.g. in classroom or public settings).

Databrary does **not** require contributors to have used the Databrary Release, or that researchers ask about sharing at the end. 

## Correlating with release levels

The template is also designed to help researchers standardize the language used and know what [release level](|filename|release-levels.md) to tag each session with based on their participants' decisions. 
No matter what form or language is used to gather releases for Databrary sharing, contributors must determine which release level each participant agreed to and tag each session (or portion of a sesson) with the correct level of sharing.
