To become an Authorized Investigator or Affiliate Investigator, applicants must first [register](http://databrary.org/register) and read and agree to the [Databrary Investigator Agreement](|filename|../policies/investigator-agreement.mdi).

To complete the authorization process, the applicant's agreement must be co-signed in one of the following ways:

- Authorized Investigators must obtain approval from an authorized representative of their Institution (usually from the Grants and Contracts or the Sponsored Programs Office).
- Affiliate Investigators must obtain approval from the Authorized Investigator who oversees their research and who has already completed the authorization process.

Authorized Investigators should understand the levels of access they can grant to the [Affiliate they manage](|filename|getting-authorized/affilates.md)
