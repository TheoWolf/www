# Descriptive Information

Before your data are made available for sharing, it's important to have descriptive information about your dataset or study. This helps to ensure that your work is summarized and represented in a way that accurately portrays your work and helps it makes sense to others.   

Usually it makes sense to name a Databrary study with the same title as any published material.
However, other organizational units that are unique to Databrary will require you to provide new names and descriptions.

## Names of Datasets
 
The title of your dataset should reflect the procedures and participants involved in the study.
We prefer that you use descriptive names rather than idiosyncratic names. Think of the most important components of your data. It could include aspects of your dataset like the what the participants were doing, or the population you were working with.

You may also optionally provide an "alias" for each dataset or study, which can be any short name you use internally within your lab to refer to the research.
This name will not be shown to other users on Databrary, so here you can use any idiosyncratic or temporary descriptions you wish.

## Summaries of Datasets

Weâ€™ll need you to summarize your dataset in a short paragraph that describes the participants, procedures, a physical description of the critical activities, and the setting in which it took place. You do not need to describe the motivation or rationale for collecting the data because this information will be attached to your studies in the form of the (un)published abstract. 

Some questions to help you write your summary:
* Was there a specific population you were studying? 
* What did your participants do? 
* Did they come in multiple times?
* Over what time period did you collect these data?
* Where did you collect these data? 

## Tasks

We'll need you to name the particular activities participants attempted in your sessions. Like the dataset names, we want these names to be descriptive. You can further define these tasks by attaching any sort of  documentation you may have explaining your protocols or methodology. This could include instructions given to a participant.
