# Levels of Organization

We organize data in terms of what we call **sessions**, **datasets**, and **studies**. You will need to consider how to organize your data within this structure. 

## Session

Databrary is designed so that the most basic unit of organization is a session. We consider a **session** to be a specific period of time during which data were collected from a participant or participants, typically a single visit. Sessions are like folders that contain all the raw data collected during this visit, including videos, survey responses, or other measurements or observations.

## Dataset

We then collect sessions into a **dataset**. Datasets typically reflect a set of related procedures or data from a group of participants observed longitudinally. Datasets can be as big or as small as suits your research design. Often a dataset is equivalent to a single research study, but one dataset can also span multiple studies or multiple datasets can be combined into a single study. Datasets include everything you did to collect your raw video data, so if available include a description of your collection protocol and stimuli or displays shown to participants.

## Study

Once you have one or more datasets, you can create what we call a **study** to represent a research product. Typically, a study represents a single published paper or other research product, but it could also reflect unpublished research. Often a study and a dataset are the same, but a study can be made up of sessions from multiple datasets, or can be a subset of a dataset. Studies can also other relevant information, including links to published papers, coding manuals, coding spreadsheets, analyses files, figures, presentations, and other metadata associated with the analysis of your data.

# Titles and Descriptions

Usually it makes sense to title a Databrary study with the same name as any published material.
However, other organizational units that are unique to Databrary will require you to provide new names and descriptions.
 
## Names of Datasets
 
The title of your dataset should reflect the procedures and participants involved in the study.
We prefer that you use descriptive names rather than idiosyncratic names. Think of the most important components of your data. It could include aspects of your dataset like the what the participants were doing, or the population you were working with.

You may also optionally provide an "alias" for each dataset or study, which can be any short name you use internally within your lab to refer to the research.
This name will not be shown to other users on Databrary, so here you can use any idiosyncratic or temporary descriptions you wish.

## Summaries of Datasets

Weâ€™ll need you to summarize your dataset in a short paragraph that describes the participants, procedures, a physical description of the critical activities, and the setting in which it took place. You do not need to describe the motivation or rationale for collecting the data because this information will be attached to your studies in the form of the (un)published abstract. 

## Tasks

We'll need you to name the particular activities participants attempted in your sessions. Like the dataset names, we want these names to be descriptive. You can further define these tasks by attaching any sort of  documentation you may have explaining your protocols or methodology. This could include instructions given to a participant.

# Exclusions and Pilots

In any study, there are going to be participants that are not included in final analysis for many reasons. Maybe you were trying to determine how to run an session with pilot participants, or a participant was unable to complete a task. You are encouraged to share these sessions with Databrary, but you will want to make it clear that these sessions were not included in a final research project. 

Accordingly, you can mark the sessions that were not included in a study and note why. Refer to [Definitions of Suggested Fields](../collecting-shareable-data/planning-for-data-sharing/definitions.html) for more information.

# Longitudinal Studies

It may be that you conduct multi-visit or longitudinal studies where you keep track of the same participants. Databrary can organize your data this way as long as you provide consistent subject IDs. You can collect the different visits as different datasets, or organize your datasets by the types of tasks participants completed, create datasets that are defined by both visit and task, or organize your data in other ways.
