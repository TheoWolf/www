#Responsibilities of Authorized and Affiliate Investigators

As an Authorized Investigator, I agree to abide by Databrary’s three key ethical principles, which are as follows:

- I will treat Data taken from or contributed to Databrary with the same high standards of care that I would treat Data collected in my own laboratory.
- I will take care in authorizing other people (affiliates and collaborators) and I understand that I am responsible for their conduct and use of Databrary data, just as they are in my own laboratory.
- For any data that I may share, I will be responsible for getting participant permission levels correct. I will do my best to ensure that participants' wishes are respected in the data they contribute.

Furthermore, I acknowledge that my use of the Databrary is contingent on the following:

- I will keep current my contact information and other information about me I have provided to Databrary. I agree to renew my status with Databrary every other year or whenever I change Institutions.
- I will not share my login information (user name and password) with anyone and will keep it secure.
- I will keep officials at my Institution who supervise research informed about my use of Databrary. I agree that Databrary may share information about my use of the data library with my Institution.
- I will comply with all relevant rules and regulations imposed by my Institution. I will consult with the appropriate officials at my Institution’s Institutional Review Board and secure whatever approvals (or waivers) are required for my use of Databrary resources whether for Non-Research or Research purposes. Institutional Review Boards may permit Non-Research use of Data without requiring formal review or approval.
- I will follow Databrary's Best Practices in Data Security for any information I draw from Databrary or collect to contribute to Databrary.
- I have read and understand the Databrary Bill of Rights.
- I have read and understand the Databrary Data Sharing Manifesto.
- I will cite all Databrary resources I use in my scholarly work. Databrary will provide a recommended citation format.
- I will manage the privileges of Authorized Affiliates whose research I oversee. If I am not eligible to be named or not approved as an Authorized Investigator, I understand that my access privileges may be managed or restricted by the Authorized Investigator who oversees my research.
- I will use Data exclusively for the purpose of scientific research or education under the auspices of either an academic, research, government, health, or a commercial entity (but in the last case, solely for non-commercial purposes

If a study takes place in a home or other setting, aspects of that home or setting may be recorded. 
Thus, individuals or locations may be identified from Recordings. 
Any disclosure of the identity of Research Participants violates the Promise of Confidentiality given to them.
