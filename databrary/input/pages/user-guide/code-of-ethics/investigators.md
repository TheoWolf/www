Title: Responsibilities of Investigators
Brief: Responsibilities of Investigators
Order: 2200

Authorized and Affiliate Investigators and their [Institutions](|filename|institutional-guidance.md) have specific responsibilities in association with Databrary. This page describes them.

## Motivation

Recordings may contain Personally Identifying Information about Depicted Individuals. These may be Research Participants as well as other individuals who are incidentally recorded or photographed. Images and/or voices may be visible or heard and names may be spoken out loud. Images and voices of visitors or other people who are not research participants may be recorded. If a study takes place in a home or other setting, aspects of that home or setting may be recorded. Thus, individuals or locations may be identified from Recordings. Any disclosure of the identity of Research Participants violates the Promise of Confidentiality given to them. Identification of other individuals depicted in Recordings violates their privacy, as well.

De-Identified Data, Non-Identifiable Data, and Metadata may be combined to identify research participants. De-Identified Data, Non-Identifiable Data, and Metadata may be combined with Recordings to identify individuals or cause them harm or embarrassment. These represent significant risks. Accordingly, in order to avoid risks associated with the identification of individuals depicted in Recordings which could potentially cause harm or embarrassment, Investigators seeking access to Databrary promise the following:

## Ethical principles

- To treat data taken from or contributed to Databrary with the same high standards of care that one would treat data collected in an Investigator's own laboratory.
- To take care in authorizing other people (Affiliates) to access Databrary and to take responsiblility for the use of Databrary by these individuals.
- To ensure that participants' wishes about whether and how widely identifiable data should be shared are respected; portray accurately and faithfully information about those wishes to Databrary.

## Contact information and identity

Investigators will keep current their contact information and other information provided to Databrary. Investigators agree to renew their status with Databrary as required by Databrary or whenever they change Institutions.

Investigators agree that Databrary will reveal to the public their name, photo, Institutional affiliations, and any other information provided as part of the Investigator's profile.

Investigators agree not to share personal login information (user name and password) with anyone and will keep it secure.

## Communication with the Institution

Investigators will comply with all relevant rules and regulations imposed by their Institution regarding the use of Databrary. Investigators will consult with the appropriate officials at the ethics or Institutionâ€™s Institutional Review Board or its equivalent and secure whatever approvals (or waivers) are required for their use of Databrary resources whether for Non-Research or Research purposes. Ethics, Institutional Review Boards or their equivalents may permit Non-Research use of Data without requiring formal review or approval.
 
Investigators will keep officials at their Institution who supervise research informed about their use of Databrary. 
 
Investigators agree that Databrary may share information about an Investigator's use of Databrary with the Investigator's Institution.

Authorized Investigators agree to complete research ethics training that meets the Institution's standards.

## Databrary policies

Investigators agree to follow Databrary's Best Practices in Data Security for any information they draw from Databrary or collect to contribute to Databrary.

Investigators agree that they have read and understood the Databrary Bill of Rights, the Databrary Data Sharing Manifesto, and other Databrary policies.
