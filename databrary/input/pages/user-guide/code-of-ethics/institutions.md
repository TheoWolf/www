# Responsibilities of Institutions

Investigators and their Institutions have specific responsibilities in association with Databrary. Additional guidance for Institutions may be found [here](|filename|../institutional-guidance.md).

Databrary requires that an applicant for Authorized Investigator status be associated with an Institution. An official with authority to sign on behalf of the Institution must co-sign the [Databrary Access Agreement](|filename|../policies/investigator-agreement.mdi). In co-signing the Databrary Access Agreement, an Institution agrees to the following:

## Qualifications of Authorized Investigators

The Institution verifies that the applicant for Authorized Investigator status is eligible to conduct independent research at the Institution.

The Institution validates that any Authorized Investigator affiliated with the Institution has research ethics training that meets the Institution's standards.

The Institution maintains an ethics or Institutional Review Board (IRB) or an equivalent entity that oversees the scientific activities of every Authorized Investigator affiliated with the Institution. 

The Institution grants Authorized Investigators the responsibility to choose Affiliate Investigators who meet Databrary's qualifications and who agree to follow Databrary's ethical principles. The Institution holds Authorized Investigators responsible for the conduct of Affiliate Investigators they select.

## Data sharing and use

The Institution asserts that it has the rights to share with Databrary any Data the Authorized Investigator contributes; no other entity or individual has ownership rights that prevent the Authorized Investigator from contributing Data to Databrary.

The Institution agrees to allow use of the Data exclusively for the purpose of scientific research or education under the auspices of an academic, research, government, health, or commercial entity (but in the last case, solely for non-commercial purposes).

The Institution agrees not to sell or trade Data or use it for other commercial purposes.

The Institution grants each Authorized Investigator authority to decide when and with whom the Authorized Investigator wishes to share Data, and the Institution holds the Authorized Investigator responsible for the use of shared Data. 

The Institution agrees to follow all relevant national, state, and local laws and regulations that pertain to the use of research Data.
