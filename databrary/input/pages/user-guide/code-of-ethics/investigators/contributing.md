# Rights of Data Contributors

When contributing Data to Databrary, Authorized Investigarors may decide whether to share, when to share, and with whom to share their data, within the parameters defined by Databrary. 

By default, all new data that is uploded to Databrary is private and is accessible only to the data ownder and selected individuals that are granted full access to the data.
Even when the data is private, Data may be shared among members of my approved research protocol.

Databrary can store Data regardless of whether it is shared, but asks that at least one of the participants was asked for their release to share their data, regardless of their decision. 
The data will be available based on my sharing decisions that authorized users have elected pursuant to Databrary's polices and procedures and the Release Level granted by Depicted Individuals or Research Participants. 
Even if a dataset or study is shared, only the released data will be accessible to other investigators. Non-released data will remain exclusively available to the data owner and selected collaborators.

However, Databrary reserves the right to limit the amount or kind of Data stored without charge to Data Contributors or the level of service provided to Data Contributors and other researchers. 
Data that has been shared with all Databrary Investigators may have priority for storage and processing resources.
Authorized Investigators may change or revoke the rights for other Databrary users to access my Data at any time. 
Databrary cannot guarantee Data previously shared can be retrieved.

Databrary encourages researchers to share any  products of their scientific work, including Metadata, links to publications resulting from Data, coding manuals, coding spreadsheets, lab notebooks, analysis code, figures, manuscripts that are not copyrighted, and other materials as broadly as possible.
