Title: Adding the Databrary Release to Your IRB Protocol
Brief: The Databrary Release
Slug: user-guide/releasing-data/adding-databrary-release
Order: 3330

# Rationale

Databrary requires that investigators have approval before sharing data.
Not only must the investigator's IRB approve plans to share with Databrary, but so must research participants, at least in most cases.
Since video and audio recordings and photographs contain personally identifying information (PII), Databrary requires investigators to get permission from the people depicted in these recordings or images before sharing.

Many PIs already have a separate release form used for getting permission to play recordings or show images.
The [Databrary Release Template](../policies/release-template.html) is similar.
It's designed to let the people depicted in recordings or photographs give informed permission to allow their data to be shared.

Since most PIs *do not* have authorization from their IRBs to share with Databrary or to ask participants for permission to share, PIs must seek IRB approval before sharing.
PIs may either submit a new research protocol or revise an existing protocol.

# New protocol submission

New protocol submissions should include the [Databrary Release Template](../policies/release-template.html) adapted for use at the PI's institution.

# Protocol modification

Modified protocols should include the [Databrary Release Template](../policies/release-template.html) and possibly revisions to Informed Consent/Assent documents.

# Data destruction

Some IRBs suggest or encourage PIs to destroy data after some period of time.
Plans for how long data will be kept and when data will be destroyed are contained within Informed Consent/Assent documents.

Data destruction is not required by NIH guidelines.
PIs should not promise to destroy data since this limits how data might be shared and re-used.
Instead, PIs should indicate in IRB applications and Informed Consent/Assent documents that "data will be stored indefinitely in a secure digital data library."

# After IRB approval

Once a PI has official approval to share with Databrary, she may begin asking research participants for their permission to share.
PIs must make sure that they faithfully record the level of permission granted and accurately convey that information to Databrary.

# Grandfathering data

Some PIs might be using a video, audio or photograph release form that is similar to Databrary's.
In that case, the PI may apply for permission to share with Databrary if the PI's IRB determines that the existing release provides equivalent protections.
In this case, some recordings that have already been collected might be shared with Databrary.
See [Grandfathering Data](grandfathering-data.html) for more information.

# Technical assistance

Local, state, and national regulations and laws differ, as do the practices of IRBs and their equivalents.
