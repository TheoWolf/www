Title: Adding the Databrary Release to Your IRB Protocol

## Adapting the Databrary Release Template 

The [Databrary Release template](|filename|../policies/release-template.mdi) has been developed in close consultation with IRB officials at NYU and PSU. 
It clearly explains to people depicted in recordings or photographs what it would mean to share their data in Databrary and allows them to make an informed decision about doing so.
The template is **completely** adaptable. Researchers may modify it as appropriate to suit the needs of their project. 
Databrary does not need to approve changes to the template--only the home IRB must approve of the version that is given to participants.

## Consenting is not releasing 
The Databrary Release is unique in one important way: it allows researchers to completely separate consenting to participate from releasing their data for sharing.
We advise introducing the Databrary Release at the end of the session, so that participants know what was recorded and what would be shared. 
By asking about sharing with Databrary at the end researchers will have much less reason to worry that participants will choose not to enter a study because they are uncomfortable with sharing their information. 
Participants will also know what was done during the session and have a clearer understanding of what they would be agreeing to share. 
Even this is entirely adaptable. 
There may be other constraints where asking at the end is not preferred or is infeasible. 

However, the following considerations may apply when choosing when to introduce the Release:

- If the researcher would like to give participants the option to select which part or parts of the session to share, the form could be given at the end of each section; alternatively, the form could be adapted to allow participants to answer about each section separately at the end of the entire session.
- It might be appropriate to ask about sharing at the end of a longitudinal study, so that asking about sharing doesn't affect the likelihood of attrition. 
- If there is information or activities of a sensitive nature in some portion of the session, the researcher may choose not to ask any participants to share that portion of the session. In this case, researchers may prefer to adapt the form to indicate that the sensitive portion will not be shared. (Remember, the contributor can always choose not to share certain parts of the video even if the participant said they could be shared.)
- There are cases where it is more feasible or necessary to offer the Databrary Release at the beginning of the study (e.g. in classroom or public settings).

Databrary does **not** require contributors to have used the Databrary Release, or that researchers ask about sharing at the end. 


## Correlating with release levels

The template is also designed to help researchers standardize the language used and know what [release level](|filename|release-levels.md) to tag each session with based on their participants' decisions. 
No matter what form or language is used to gather releases for Databrary sharing, contributors must determine which release level each participant agreed to and tag each session (or portion of a sesson) with the correct level of sharing.

## Technical assistance

Local, state, and national regulations and laws differ, as do the practices of each IRB (or their equivalents).
