Title: Adding the Databrary Release to Your IRB Protocol
Brief: The Databrary Release
Slug: user-guide/releasing-data/adding-release
Order: 3320

## Adapting the Databrary Release Template 

The [Databrary Release template](../policies/release-template.html)has been developed in close consultation with IRB officials at NYU and PSU. 
It allows people depicted in recordings or photographs to clearly understand what it would mean to share their data in Databrary and to give informed consent to release their data for sharing.
The template is completely adaptable to suit the unique needs of each investigator and/or project. 
Databrary does not need to approve changes to the template--only the home IRB must approve of the version that is given to participants.

## Special features 
The Databrary Release is unique in one really important way: it allows researchers to completely separate participating from sharing.a[release levels](|filename|release-levels.md) 

The template also can help researchers standardize the language used and know what [release level](|filename|release-levels.md) to tag each session with based on their participants' decisions. 
No matter what form or language is used to gather releases for Databrary sharing, contributors must determine which release level each participant agreed to and tag each session (or portion of a sesson) with the correct level of sharing.

## Technical assistance

Local, state, and national regulations and laws differ, as do the practices of each IRB (or their equivalents).
