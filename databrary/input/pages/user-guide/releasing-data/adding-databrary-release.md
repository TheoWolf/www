Title: Adding the Databrary Release to Your IRB Protocol
Brief: The Databrary Release
Slug: user-guide/releasing-data/adding-release
Order: 3320

## Adapting the Databrary Release Template 

The [Databrary Release template](../policies/release-template.html)has been developed in close consultation with IRB officials and has been refined based on feedback from researchers and participants. 
It is designed to let the people depicted in recordings or photographs give informed consent to release their data for sharing it.
It is only a template and can be adapted to suit the unique needs of each investigator and/or project, as well as the local IRB policies that govern an investigatorâ€™s research. 
If you have any questions about sharing data or using the Databrary Release template, please contact us at help@databrary.org.

## Technical assistance

Local, state, and national regulations and laws differ, as do the practices of each IRB (or their equivalents).
If you need help seeking IRB approval to share with Databrary, please contact help@databrary.org.
