Title: Adding the Databrary Release to Your IRB Protocol
Brief: The Databrary Release
Slug: user-guide/releasing-data/adding-databrary-release
Order: 3310

Databrary requires that investigators have IRB approval before sharing data.
Not only must the investigator's IRB approve plans to share with Databrary, but so must research participants, at least in most cases.
Since video and audio recordings and photographs contain personally identifying information (PII), Databrary requires investigators to get permission from the people depicted in these recordings or images before sharing.
The Databrary Release Template is designed to let the people depicted in recordings or photographs give informed consent to release their data for sharing it.

#Using the Databrary Release

## How do I prepare to share with Databrary?

Here's what you should do:

1. Ensure that your IRB protocol(s) enable sharing with Databrary. 	
	- We recommend adapting the [Databrary Release Template](|filename|../policies/release-template.mdi) for use at the local institution. 
	- The language in the Databrary Release is only a template and can be adapted to suit the unique needs of each investigator and/or project, as well as the local IRB policies that govern an investigatorâ€™s research.
1. Double-check your existing protocol and informed consent/assent documents for data destruction clauses.
	- You will  want to review your informed consent documents and remove any data destruction clauses as these inherently conflict with the ability to store and share data. Instead, we recommend saying "Data will be stored indefinitely in a secure library on the internet." 
	- NIH and NSF **do not** require data destruction clauses.
1. Once you have modified your IRB protocol(s), start securing and recording those permissions from participants. 
	- We advise researchers to ask participants for permission to share at the **end** of data collection so that participants have acquired first hand knowledge about the study. This ensures that consent to participate is completely separate from permission to share and eliminates nearly all risk that asking participants about sharing their data will affect their decision about whether or not to participate.
1. Prepare recordings for sharing with Databrary, including tagging files with the level of permission for each session. Remove personally identifying information from other data and metadata.
	- Data can be uploaded to Databrary *prior* to sharing it with anyone. In this way, Databrary can act like a lab file server. You can decide later whether you want to share data with researchers who are not part of your approved IRB protocol.

User must be [authorized](|fileame|../getting-authorized/getting-authorized.md) and granted Principal Investigator or Affiliate Investigator status with Databrary in order to open data for sharing with the Databrary community.

## Technical assistance

Local, state, and national regulations and laws differ, as do the practices of each IRB (or their equivalents).
