Title: Collecting Shareable Data
Brief: Collecting Shareable Data
Slug: user-guide/releasing-data
Order: 3300

Since video and audio recordings and photographs are inherently identifiable, Databrary requires investigators to have IRB approval and to get permission from the people depicted in recordings or images to share their data in Databrary.
We know that sharing identifiable data is possible as long as you tell the people depicted in the recordings what it means to share their data and they agree to share it.

## How do I prepare to share with Databrary?

Here's what you should do:

1. Ensure that your IRB protocol(s) enable sharing with Databrary. 	
	- Any language that your IRB deems equivalent to sharing in Databrary is acceptable. The contributor researcher must warrant they have IRB approval to use the   
	- We recommend adapting the [Databrary Release Template](|filename|../policies/release-template.mdi) and getting IRB approval to give the form to participants. 
1. Double-check your existing protocol and informed consent/assent documents for data destruction clauses.
	- Data destruction clauses inherently conflict with the ability to store and share data. Instead, we recommend saying "Data will be stored indefinitely in a secure library on the internet."
	- There is often misconception about the regulations around data destruction. NIH and NSF **do not** require data destruction clauses.
1. Once you have modified your IRB protocol(s), start securing and recording those permissions from participants. 
	- We advise researchers to ask participants for permission to share at the **end** of data collection so that participants have acquired first hand knowledge about the study. This ensures that consent to participate is completely separate from permission to share and eliminates nearly all risk that asking participants about sharing their data will affect their decision about whether or not to participate.
1. Prepare recordings for sharing with Databrary, including tagging files with the level of permission for each session. Remove personally identifying information from other data and metadata.
	- Data can be uploaded to Databrary *prior* to sharing it with anyone. In this way, Databrary can act like a lab file server. You can decide later whether you want to share data with researchers who are not part of your approved IRB protocol.

Please note that users must be [authorized](|fileame|../getting-authorized/getting-authorized.md) with Databrary in order to open data for sharing with the Databrary community.
