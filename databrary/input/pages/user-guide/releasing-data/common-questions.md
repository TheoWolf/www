Title: Common Questions about Sharing Video Data
Brief: Common Questions

## How can identifiable data that I collect be shared outside of my lab?

Data can only be shared with other Databrary authorized users if (i) the data are [de-identified](../policies/definitions.html#de-identified-data), or (ii) the data are video or audio recordings or photographs in which the people depicted have given permission for their data to  be shared. 

Many flat-file data sets can be easily de-identified, but de-identifying recordings is complicated, expensive, and diminishes their value to other researchers. 
So, to share recordings without removing personal identifiers, Databrary asks researchers to get permission to share from those people who are depicted in recordings. 
To standardize the process and make it as simple as possible for researchers, we have developed the [Databrary Release Template](|filename|../policies/release-template.mdi) that can be added to IRB protocols and used with participants.

The Databrary Release Template was developed and refined in close consultation with the IRB office at NYU to give Databrary Investigators a standardized way to obtain the necessary permissions to be shared in Databrary. 
The template form is designed to make it as clear and unambiguous as possible to participants about what agreeing to share their data in Databrary will mean.

## When should I share data?

Our philosophy about Data Sharing is embodied in our [Data Sharing Manifesto](|filename|../policies/data-sharing-manifesto.mdi). We believe sharing data will accelerate the pace of discovery and will lead to stronger, more transperent science.

Unless required by journals or funding agenices, you are never required by Databrary to share data if you do not wish to do so. 

Even if you aren't sure you want to share data now, you may want to be ready to share data in the future. Or, maybe you have archival data you would like to share now, but you aren't sure whether you are able to do so. Here are the steps to take. 

## Can I share data I've already collected?

Some investigators already ask research participants for permission to share [recordings](../policies/definitions.html#recordings) with other researchers or to show them for educational or scientific purposes. 
This permission is often acquired by means of a video, audio or photograph release form that is similar to Databrary's. In this case, some recordings that have already been collected might be shared with Databrary.

If you have language that gives you permission to share or show recordings, you may apply to share these data with Databrary if your IRB rules that your release language is equivalent to Databrary's, or that your data require no such release to share.
