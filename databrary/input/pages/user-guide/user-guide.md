Databrary is federally funded by the NSF and the NIH to create a library for sharing video and metadata for developmental and behavioral research.
Access is limited to Authorized users.
Users must sign the [Databrary Investigator Agreement](|filename|policies/investigator-agreement.mdi)  and have their agreement co-signed by their Institution or Sponsor to become authorized.

Data are only visible if they have been: (a) released by the participants for sharing in Databrary and (b) released for sharing by the contributing researcher.

The Databrary User Guide helps to explain how to collect data that can be shared, upload and manage your own data, become an authorized user, and explore the data shared in Databrary.

You can find all our latest policy documents in our [Policies](|filename|policies/policies.md) section.
Terms in *italics* are defined [here](|filename|../policies/definitions.mdi).
