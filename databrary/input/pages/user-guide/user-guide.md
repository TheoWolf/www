Databrary is federally funded by the NSF and the NIH to create a library for sharing video and metadata for developmental and behavioral research. Access is limited to Authorized users. Users must sign the [Databrary Investigator Agreement](policies/investigator-agreement.md)  and have their agreement co-signed by their Institution or Sponsor to become authorized.
 
Data are only visible if they have been: (a) released by the participants for sharing in Databrary and (b) released for sharing by the contributing researcher. 

We will soon have a Databrary User Guide covering all aspects of the project. Until then, you can visit our [Getting Started](user-guide/getting-started.html) section. You can find all our latest policy documents in our [Policies](user-guide/policies.html) section.
