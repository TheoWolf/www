## Reuse, publish, and spread the word!

Databrary and Datavyu provide valuable tools for increasing transparency and
reproducibility in the developmental sciences. But in order to succeed, we need the Databrary community to help us increase our collection, and our profile in published works. So, pleaseâ€¦

- **...credit the researcher**: Every volume is provided with a Databrary specific citation: please go to the volume page and use the citation listed under "How To Cite" to ensure that the contributor receives proper credit.

- **...reference Databrary and Datavyu**: If you re-used an existing Databrary volume, used Databrary to store or manage your own research data, or used Datavyu to code your data, please give us credit in your Methods, a footnote, or endnote. Feel free to use our suggested text below, or to craft your own.
