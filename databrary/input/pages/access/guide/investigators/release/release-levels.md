Title: Databrary Release Levels
Brief: Databrary Release Levels
Order: 3240

Below are the release levels used within Databrary to determine if identifiable data can be made visible to anyone outside of the individuals named on the original IRB protocol.
These release levels map directly to the options on the [Databrary Release Template](|filename|../../../policies/release-template.mdi).

| Release Level | Definition |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Missing** | Releases were not obtained or are otherwise unavailable. This is the default, and is effectively equivalent to private.
|
| **Private** | The participant(s) did not agree to share their data.
|
| **Shared** | The participant(s) agreed to have their data shared with the Databrary community.
|
|**Excerpts** | The participant(s) agreed to have their data shared with the Databrary community and allowed for excerpts to be shown to the public.
|
| **Public** | The participant(s) agreed to have their data shared with the world at large (not currently incorporated into Databrary Release Template).
