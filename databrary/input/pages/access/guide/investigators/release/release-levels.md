Title: Databrary Release Levels
Brief: Databrary Release Levels
Order: 3240

Below are the release levels used within Databrary to determine if identifiable data can be made visible to anyone outside of the individuals named on the original IRB protocol.
These release levels map directly to the options on the [Databrary Release Template](|filename|../../../policies/release-template.mdi).

|Symbol| Release Level | Definition |
|------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
|<img src="https://nyu.databrary.org/web/icons/release/unknown.svg">| **Unreleased** | Releases were not obtained or are otherwise unavailable. This is the default, and is effectively equivalent to private.
|
|<img src="https://nyu.databrary.org/web/icons/release/private.svg">| **Private** | Available only to collaborators.
|
|<img src="https://nyu.databrary.org/web/icons/release/shared.svg">| **Shared** | Available only to authorized Databrary users.
|
|<img src="https://nyu.databrary.org/web/icons/release/excerpts.svg">|**Excerpts** | Available only to authorized Databrary users, who may show it publicly in presentations for informational or educational purposes. I understand that such presentations may be videotaped or recorded and that those videos or recordings may then be made available to the public via the internet (e.g., YouTube).
|
|<img src="https://nyu.databrary.org/web/icons/release/public.svg">| **Public** | Available openly to anybody (not currently incorporated into Databrary Release Template).
