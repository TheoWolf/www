Title: Authorized Investigators
Brief: Investigators
Order: 2200

This section describes the rights and responsibilities of *authorized investigators* associated with their use of Databrary.

To become authorized, applicants must register and sign the Databrary Access Agreement and have their agreement signed by an authorized representative of their institution.

*Authorized investigators* should understand their specific rights and responsibilities when [contributing data](|filename|investigators/contributing.md), [using data](|filename|investigators/using-data.md), [respecting participant release levels](|filename|investigators/sharing-principles.md), and [managing *affiliates*](|filename|investigators/affiliates.md).

## Guiding Ethical Principles

Databrary's three guiding ethical principles embody the commitment that is expected of all community members to build a community that follows the highest ethical standards.

As a member of the Databrary community you promise to:

1. Treat Databrary data with the **same high standard of care** that you treat data collected in your own laboratory.
1. Ensure that participants' wishes about sharing their data are respected. 
1. Take care in granting and managing access for *affiliates* and take responsibility for their use of Databrary.

## Specific Responsibilities for Authorized Investigators

As an *authorized investigator* you agree to:

1. Comply with your institution's policies on the conduct of research.
1. Have completed research ethics training that meets the institution's standards.
1. Keep your contact information and institutional affiliation current on Databrary.

Investigators agree to follow all relevant national, state, and local laws and regulations that pertain to the use of Databrary resources.

Investigators acknowledge that they have read and understand the Databrary Bill of Rights, the Databrary Data Sharing Manifesto, and all other Databrary policies.

Each party shall be responsible for its negligent acts or omissions and the negligent acts or omissions of its employees, officers, or director's, to the extent allowed by law.

Researchers agree to use the highest level of professional judgment and to uphold the highest ethical principles in protecting the privacy interests of human participants depicted in Databrary excerpts, and in determining which excerpts and images will be shared in public settings (e.g., research presentations, class lectures) for informational or educational purposes. Researchers understand that such uses (e.g., research presentations, class lectures) may be videotaped or recorded and that those videos or recordings may then be made available to the public via the internet (e.g., YouTube).
Wherever reasonably possible, researchers will restrict the extent of public exposure to such human subjects, either through password-protected media, closed groups, or through selective use of images.
