*Authorized investigators* agree to not share personal login information (user name and password) with anyone and will keep it secure. *Authorized investigators* may authorize other users as their *affiliate*s. 

*Authorized investigator*s assume the responsibility for choosing Affiliates who meet Databrary's qualifications and who agree to follow Databrary's ethical principles.
*Authorized investigator*s agree to be responsible for the conduct of Affiliates they select.
