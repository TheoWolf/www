	<h2>What is Databrary?</h2>

	<div>
		<p>Databrary is a digital data library that is specialized for storing, managing, preserving, analyzing, and sharing video and other temporally dense streams of data. It is designed by researchers who wish to share with other researchers. But, some materials may be viewed by the public -- where participants give appropriate permission or there is no concern about violating privacy.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section class="question">
	<h2>Why should I contribute my data or tools to an open data sharing library?</h2>

	<div>
		<p>Data sharing embodies the ideals of open scientific inquiry. It contributes to transparency and bolsters scientific integrity.</p>
		<p>A history of data sharing and a plan to commit data to an open share will enhance the likelihood of funding. Federal funding agencies and private foundations are now requesting data management and data sharing plans. Your work will receive more citations. Users will cite your data set or tools and the papers associated with them.</p>
		<p>The more investigators who share and the more information they share, the more the community of researchers will benefit, the more scientists will discover, and the more the public will benefit.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section class="question">
	<h2>Will I receive credit for my contributions if other researchers use my data?</h2>

	<div>
		<p>Yes. Users will sign an agreement stating that they will acknowledge contributors by citing any data or tool they use from Databrary. Databrary will provide permanent links and a citation format.</p>
		<p>Databrary will also keep track of the number of times your personal, lab, and project pages are viewed, as well as the number of times your data are viewed, downloaded, or excerpted. These measures of your
		scholarly impact will be reported to you.</p>

<section class="question">
	<h2>What can I contribute?</h2>

	<div>
		<p>Databrary is specialized for storing and sharing video and other streams of data that are temporally dense, such as audio, motion tracking, eye tracking, and physiological measures. You may share examples of computer-based displays or other supplemental materials associated with a published study or conference presentation such as manuscript drafts, coded spreadsheets, codebooks, questionnaires, instruments, or analysis spreadsheets.</p>
		<p>Databrary encourages contributors to share metadata about the settings (date, time, location), participants (e.g., age, sex, handedness, race or ethnicity), measures (e.g., video, survey, computer-task) in a given data collection session. We also encourage researchers to provide study-level metadata (human/animal, naturalistic/experimental, cross-sectional/longitudinal). These rich forms of metadata will help users to search, browse, aggregate, and reuse datasets.</p>
		<p>Because video and audio recordings and photographs may depict faces, voices, names, or other personally identifying information (see <a href='/access/policies/definitions.html'>Databrary glossary</a>), special care must be taken. The people depicted must give explicit permission for the recordings or photographs to be shared with Databrary. Databrary has created <a href="/access/policies/release-template.html">template documents</a> for this purpose. </p>
		<p>In other data formats such as text files and spreadsheets, participants must be denoted by code number not names. Personally identifying information must be removed before data are deposited. Databrary recommends <em>authorized investigators</em> adopt <a href='/access/policies/best-practices.html'>best practices for data security</a> and uphold the <a href='/access/policies/bill-of-rights.html' target='_blank'>Databrary Bill of Rights</a>.</p>
		<p>Tool contributors can share tools and algorithms for visualizing, exploring, and analyzing data, and other uses. Links and scripts will enable interoperability between coded data and tools. Open source tools can share the source code.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section class="question">
	<h2>What about privacy?</h2>

	<div>
		<p>Databrary takes privacy very seriously, but we also believe in the principle of informed consent. We believe that many people who participate in scientific research will give permission for their data to be shared if they can be confident that their privacy and dignity will be respected. Databrary has designed policies and systems to ensure this happens.</p>
		<p>At the end of a research study, people depicted in video and audio recordings and photographs should be asked for their permission to share with other investigators. They can choose whether to share or not and whether investigators can show excerpts from their recordings to the public. No one is coerced to say yes. Sensitive or identifiable data are only shared if (i) participants have given permission for the materials to be shared, and (ii) the researcher who contributed the materials has made them available for sharing.</p>
		<p>Investigators who have recordings are permitted to share must be authorized by Databrary to have access to the library. Databrary only grants authorized access to individuals who meet certain criteria and who agree to follow Databrary's policies. The investigators must also</p>
		<ul>
			<li>show that they are knowledgeable about ethical research principles with human participants;</li>
			<li>promise to care for information they view in Databrary with the same care they would treat information they collect in their own labs;</li>
			<li>get official approval from their university or institution before sharing data with Databrary or before conducting research using Databrary resources.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
</section>

<section class="question">
	<h2>How do I access shared data?</h2>

	<div>
		<p>Some Databrary materials are shared with the general public. But, access to most data, especially identifiable or sensitive materials, is limited to people with authorization. You may browse Databrary's public information freely without authorization. Individuals who wish to access or contribute data must (<a href='/access/guide/investigators/authorization.html'>apply for authorization</a>) as an <em>authorized investigator</em> or <em>affiliate</em>. The (<a href='/access/policies/agreement.html'>Databrary Access Agreement</a>) must be signed by both the <em>authorized investigator</em> and the Institution; <em>affiliate</em> must be sponsored by an <em>authorized investigator</em>. See the information in our (<a href="/access.html">access page</a>) to learn more about what is involved in gaining access or (<a href="http://databrary.org/register">register</a>) today.</p>

<section class="question">
	<h2>When should I share data?</h2>

	<div>
		<p>Our philosophy about Data Sharing is embodied in our (<a href='/access/policies/data-sharing-manifesto.html'>Data Sharing Manifesto</a>). We believe sharing data will accelerate the pace of discovery and will lead to stronger, more transparent science.

		Unless required by journals or funding agencies, you are never required by Databrary to share data if you do not wish to do so.

		Even if you aren't sure you want to share data now, you may want to be ready to share data in the future.
		Or, maybe you have archival data you would like to share now, but you aren't sure whether you are able to do so.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section class="question">
	<h2>Can I share data I've already collected?</h2>

	<div>
		<p>Some investigators already ask research participants for permission to share (<a href='/access/policies/definitions.html#recordings'>recordings</a>) with other researchers or to show them for educational or scientific purposes. This permission is often acquired by means of a video, audio or photograph release form that is similar to Databrary's. 
		In this case, some recordings that have already been collected might be shared with Databrary. 
		If you have language that gives you permission to share or show recordings, you may apply to share these data with Databrary if your IRB rules that your release language is equivalent to Databrary's, or that your data require no such release to share.
		See (<a href='/access/guide/investigators/release/grandfathering-data.html'> Grandfathering Data</a>) for more information.

<section class="question">
	<h2>Do I have to use <a href="http://datavyu.org">Datavyu</a> to contribute data?</h2>

	<div>
		<p>No. Contributors are not required to score their data with the Datavyu coding tool. However, we encourage them to use Datavyu because it is free and open source and every user strengthens and grows the community.</p>

		<p>We will work towards round trip interoperability between Datavyu and other free or low-cost academic tools (OpenSHAPA, TalkBank, Elan, Transana). We are also aiming to build one-way translation between commercial tools (e.g., Noldus, Mangold) and Datavyu.</p>
