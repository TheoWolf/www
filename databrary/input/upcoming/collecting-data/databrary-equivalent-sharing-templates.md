# Background

Databrary recommends that new data collections use the [Databrary Release Template](http://databrary.org/user-guide/policies/release-template.html), but some PIs may wish to share data collected in the past. The following are examples of release language that an IRB has deemed provides protections equivalent or comparable to Databrary's. 

If you use a video/audio or photographic release now, consult your IRB to determine whether it enables you to share with Databrary. If your IRB says yes, please share your release with us so we can post it here.

# Video/Image release language deemed comparable to Databrary's by NYU's IRB

During the study, we will collect video and other images of your or your child’s behavior. With your consent, we would like to be able to use your or your child’s images for various educational purposes. Your or your child’s name would never be associated with any of these uses.
You have the right to refuse to allow your or your child’s images to be used in any of these ways.

Please indicate below whether you do or do not give us permission to use your or your child’s images in each of these ways:

- In presentations to psychology classes at NYU. Yes/No.
- In presentations of the research at professional meetings. Yes/No.
- In professional publications (articles and textbooks) describing the research. Yes/No.
- On Dr. Adolph’s website or professional websites designed to make research results available for professional purposes only. Yes/No.
- On recruiting advertisements for the Infant Action Lab. Yes/No.

You will receive a copy of this form. If at any time in the future you change your mind about granting us permission to use your or your child’s images, just notify us by calling the Infant Action Lab (xxx-xxx-xxxx) and we will stop using them (except in the case of images already published in books or journals).
