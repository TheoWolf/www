We are so happy you decided to share your data with the Databrary community. There are a few data practices practices we suggest you adopt going forward  with sharing on Databrary in mind. Our wish is to make this process as easy for you as possible. We've determined the best way to do this is by enumerating what we need from you.

We know data sharing is new and it can be hard to keep everything organized. We expect that that not everything we ask for is collated, organized or digitized, but we want you to start thinking about the logistics of sharing your data.  




# Collecting metadata

We know you already collect a lot of information about your data in your lab, but maybe you don't keep all that information in one place. Think about what kind of information you collect and where you currently store that information. We want you to collect all your session and participant information together in a spreadsheet. There are a few pieces of information that are the most critical for us to have: **test date**, **birth date** and **what level of sharing the participant consented to**. We do collect any information that you are willing to share with us. Please refer to our Definitions of Suggest Field (**linky this**) to see the kinds of information we want to have and how we want you to report it. 

Right now, you may collect some of your information only paper. To make sharing easier, it is useful to combine your information about sessions and participants electronically in one spreadsheet. It will make it easier to upload your data if all information about your sessions and participants is in one place. 

There may very well be other information you collect that isn't included here that would be valuable for understanding your data. Let us know what other types of information you collect, and we can include that information in Databrary.


# Files

Besides video files, we also collect other data or analysis files that supplement your data. These could be images, graphs, stimuli, protocols, blank questionnaires, blank consent forms or any other files you might have that you are willing to share. Please note if any of your files have subject data, and if it's identified or deidentifed information. Identified information can be any dates, voices, faces, location information that more specific than a state. Names and other contact information should never be included. 


* ## File Names

To make the ingest process smoother, we have a few suggestions for file names that you can adopt for data collection in your lab.

 * Use alphanumeric filenames. Letters, numbers, underscores and hyphens are okay.
  * Please remove any spaces or punctuation that is not a hyphen or underscore.
  * Make sure your file names all have extensions (.mp4, .mov, etc.). 

Note that these rules apply to video files as well as other files.

Please keep your file names consistent, so it is easier for you to match up what sessions go with what files. To ensure that your data is entered into databrary correctly, think about putting together a spreadsheet matching up file names with sessions.
