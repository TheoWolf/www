# Organizing Your Data

## Levels of Organization
Think about your data in terms of what we call **sessions**, **datasets** and **studies**. We will need you to organize your data within this structure. 

* ### Session

	Databrary is designed so that the most basic unit of organization is a session. We consider a **session** to be a specific period of time when data are collected from a participant or participants, typically a single visit. Sessions are like folders that contain all the raw data collected during this visit. including videos, survey responses, or other measurements or observations.

* ### Dataset

    We then collect sessions into a **dataset**, which is the collection of video files and other raw data. Datasets typically reflect a set of related procedures or data from a group of participants observed longitudinally. Datasets can be as big or as small as suits your research design. Often a dataset is equivalent to a study. But one dataset can spawn multiple studies. Multiple datasets can be combined into a single study. Datasets include everything you did to collect your raw video data, so if available include a protocol of your procedure and stimuli or displays shown to participants.

* ### Study

	Once you have one or more datasets, we can create what we call a **study** to represent a research product. Typically, a study is a published paper, but it could also reflect unpublished data. Often a study and a dataset are the same. But a study can be made up of sessions from multiple datasets, or can be a subset of a dataset. Studies can also include files that provide valuable information—especially links to published papers, coding manuals, and coding spreadsheets. You can also include analyses files, figures, presentations, and other metadata with your study.




# Exclusions and Pilots

In any study, there are going to be participants that are not included in final analysis for many reasons. Maybe you were trying to determine how to run an session with pilot participants. Maybe a participant was unable to complete the tasks for any reason. We understand that you while you may wish to share these sessions with databrary, you will want to make it clear that these sessions were not included in a final research project. 

You will be able to mark the sessions that were not included in a study and note why. These sessions will only exist on the dataset level and the not the study level. Refer to the Definitions of Suggested Fields to see how to mark these. (link) 



# Longitudinal Studies

It may be that you conduct multi-visit or longitudinal studies where you keep track of the same participants. Databrary can organize your data this way as long as the subject IDs you provide are consistent. You can collect the different visits as different datasets, or organize your datasets by the types of tasks participants completed, create datasets that are defined by both visit and task, or whatever other way you wish to organize your data. 

# Titles and Descriptions
 
* ### Names of Datasets
	The title of a published study will retain the same title in Databrary, but we'll ask you to provide names for your datasets. We prefer that you use descriptive names rather than idiosyncratic names. Think of the most important components of your data. It could be include aspects of your dataset like the what the particpants were doing, the population or age group you were working with.
* ### Summaries of Datasets
	We’ll need you to summarize your dataset in a short paragraph that describes the  participants, procedures, a physical description of the critical activities, and the setting in which in took place. You do not need to describe the motivation or rationale for collecting the data because this information will be attached to your studies in the form of the (un)published abstract. 

* ### Tasks

	We'll need you to name the particular activities participants attempted in your sessions. Like the dataset names, we want these names to be descriptive. You can further define these tasks by attaching any sort of  documentation you may have explaining your protocols or methodology. This could include instructions given to a participant.
