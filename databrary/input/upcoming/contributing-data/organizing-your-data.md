# Organizing Your Data

## Session

Databrary is designed so that the most basic unit of organization is a session. We consider a session to be a specific period of time when data is collected from a participant or participants, such as a single visit. Sessions are like folders that include all the raw data. Examples of data we collect include:

* video files
* audio files
* survey responses

This list is not exhaustive, and you should feel free to upload any session level files you wish to share. 

For each session, we need just a few pieces of information

* subject ID(s)
* birthdate(s)
* test date(s)
* consent level(s)

We can and will collect other information about sessions. Please see Planning for Data Sharing for more examples and what format in what format we'd like you to provide that information.

## Dataset

Sessions can then be collected into a dataset. A dataset is just a way for you to collect and find related sessions. How you relate these sessions is up to you. For example, A dataset may be all the sessions where participants did the same task(s). 

Datasets can be however large or small, depending on how much data you want to share with other people at the same time.  Here, you can include files that define the entire session. Examples of these kinds of files include:

* stimuli
* protocols
* blank questionnaires
* blank consent forms  
* photos

Of course, this list is not exhaustive, and you should feel free to upload any dataset level information you wish to share. 

Please give your dataset a short, descriptive name and include a short summary about your dataset. A few sentences or a small paragraph is enough.

You may also want to include information about what the subjects did in each session. Please give these tasks short, descriptive names (i.e. reading a book with parents, playing with an iPad, crawling over a bridge etc.) You can further define any tasks in a document we can share on databrary.


## Study

Once you have one or more datasets, we can create what we call a study to represent your research projects. The difference between a dataset and a study is that the dataset is all the raw, unrefined data. Studies include all the analysis materials and collect only the sessions you used for your final project. 

Here we can indicate which sessions were included, and for each session we can add any files about what kind of analyses you did. We can also add other files with aggregate data, manuals or source code used to perform these analyses, figures, references or links to publications or other resources. These kinds of files include:

* coding manuals
* coding spreadsheets (SPSS, etc)
* graphs
* posters
* presentations
* publications

Of course, this list is not exhaustive, and you should feel free to upload any study level information you wish to share. 

Please give your study a short, descriptive name and include a short summary of your project. A few sentences or a small paragraph is enough.

## Exclusions and Pilots

In any research project, there are going to be participants that are not included in final analysis for many reasons. Maybe you were trying to determine how to run an session with pilot participants. Maybe a participant was unable to complete the tasks for any reason. We understand that you while you may wish to share these sessions with databrary, you will want to make it clear that these sessions were not included in a final research project. 

You will be able to mark the sessions that were not included in the final research project and note why. These sessions will only exist on the dataset level and the not the study level 

Some examples of why a session may be excluded include

* did not meet inclusion criteria
* procedural/experimenter error/equipment failure
* fussy, tired, withdrew
* outlier

It may well be that there are other reasons why you excluded some sessions from your final project. Feel free to add your own exclusion reasons. 


## Longitudinal studies

It may be that you conduct multi-visit or longitudinial studies where you keep track of the same participants. Databrary can organzie your data this way as long as the subject IDs you provide are consistent. You can collect the different visits as different datasets, or organize your datasets by the types of tasks participants completed, create datasets that are defined by both visit and task, or whatever other way you wish to organize your data. The way you organize your datasets is up to you. 

After you add one or more dataset, you can create multiple studies including whatever sessions you used for as many final research projects as you want to share.
