		<h2>What is Databrary?</h2>
	</article>

	<article id="whyshare">
		<h2>Why should I contribute my data or tools to an open data sharing facility?</h2>

		<p>A history of data sharing and a plan to commit data to an open share will enhance the likelihood of funding. Federal funding agencies and private foundations are now requesting data management and data sharing plans. Your work will receive more citations. Users will cite your data set or tools and the papers associated with them.</p> 
	</article>

	<article id="credit">
		<h2>Will I receive credit for my contributions if other researchers use my data?</h2>

		<p>Yes. Users will sign a data use agreement stating that they will acknowledge contributors by citing the paper(s) or unpublished sources associated with the original data set or tools, including a URL that points to the location of their contribution in the Databrary, and citing a paper describing Databrary and Datavyu.</p> 
	</article>

	<article id="whatcon">
		<h2>What can I contribute?</h2>

		<p>Data contributors can share raw digital video files, other data streams (e.g., audio, motion tracking, eye tracking coordinates, physiological data, transcripts), papers based on the data, associated metadata (e.g., coded spreadsheets, codebook, questionnaires, instruments, analysis spreadsheets), and a handful of tags describing the overall dataset that reflect standard federal guidelines (number of participants at various ages and their sex, race, ethnicity, and geographical region, typically/atypically developing) and study design (human/animal, naturalistic/experimental, cross-sectional/longitudinal). These rich forms of metadata will help users to search for appropriate datasets within Databrary, browse the videos within datasets for particulars, and make greater use of datasets for research and teaching.</p> 

		<p>As will be noted in the consent forms, participants' faces and behaviors will be viewable on the videos, and sometimes their first names will be spoken. As is customary, in text files and spreadsheets, participants should be denoted by subject number whenever possible, not be denoted by their names. Last names, volatile information, and other identifiers should be removed from text files and spreadsheets and bleeped out of videos.</p> 

		<p>Tool contributors can share tools and algorithms for visualizing, exploring, and analysing data, and other uses. Links and scripts will enable interoperability between coded data and tools. Open source tools can share the source code.</p> 
	</article>   

	<article id="privacy">
		<h2>What about privacy?</h2>

		<p>Contributors are responsible for obtaining appropriate IRB clearance for open data sharing. A draft of the template consent form can be viewed here. Users will sign a data use agreement before gaining access to any data that are not already publically accessible.</p> 

		<p>If necessary, it is possible to password protect datasets to limit access to particular users. Contributors can use video blurring to protect participant confidentiality, but this is difficult to implement and limits the useability of the data.</p> 
	</article>

	<article id="howuse">
		<h2>What are some ways I might use it?</h2>

		<p>Consistent with NIH guidelines on data sharing, researchers can:</p>
        <ul>
		<li> Upload their own video data and metadata for sharing and archival storage so that their data will survive in usable form beyond their lifetimes</li>

		<li> Enhance teaching by extracting video clips that illustrate an empirical or theoretical point and showing it to their students</li>

		<li> Enhance classroom lessons by allowing students to observe and score children's behaviors or to run "mini-studies" across the data store</li>

		<li> Point readers and reviewers to raw video data that illustrate procedures and findings</li>

		<li> View archived data for exemplars to make comparisons with their own work, and reinforce open scientific inquiry, to check how coding was done, see what displays or apparatuses were used, and gather detailed information to understand better how conclusions were drawn</li>

		<li> Browse the database to stimulate ideas that lead to further research</li>

		<li> Expand their own sample sizes, run replication studies, examine cohort effects, and assess possible differences due to geographical location or population by using suitable data in the archive</li>

		<li> Integrate data across archived studies to create new datasets or to conduct meta-analyses on raw data or metadata</li>

		<li> Build on other researchers' codes and prior coding efforts to extend or transform prior analyses and promote further discovery, and return the results to the archive</li>

		<li> Score archived data for behaviors that were outside the scope of the original study and then return the results to the archive</li>

		<li> Use the video data themselves as stimuli in new studies</li>

		<li> Use archived data for new purposes in fields outside developmental psychology</li>

		<li> Use archived data to test the performance of visualization, exploration, and analysis tools</li>

		<li> Use various tools contributed to the archive to enhance understanding of their own data</li>

		<li> Collaborate with like-minded researchers in a sub-area of development to create corpora of data with shared coding schemes and other metadata, as exemplified by TalkBank</li></ul>

	<article id="whocon">
		<h2>Who can contribute data or tools to the open share repository?</h2>

		<p>Any researcher with appropriate IRB clearance can contribute developmental or behavioral data. The current list of contributors and pledged contributors are posted on the Databrary website.</p> 

		<p>Most potential contributors did not originally clear their studies through their IRBs with open data sharing in mind. Thus, most of our contributors are -- at present -- pledging their contributions until their studies are cleared for open data sharing.</p> 

		<p>Any researcher can contribute tools to the repository.</p>
	</article>

	<article id="howcon">
		<h2>How do I contribute?</h2>

		<p>Uploading files will be easy, quick, and painless with the Databrary data management tools.</p>
	</article>

	<article id="whencon">
		<h2>When do I contribute?</h2>

		<p>Data contributors can upload data at any point and release it openly at any point - as data are collected, after scoring the data, after manuscript submission, when a manuscript goes to press, or later.</p> 

		<p>Tool contributors can share their stuff and release it at any point - as the tools are being developed, after testing, after a manuscript goes to press, or later.</p> 
	</article>

	<article id="howsearch">
		<h2>How can I search the database?</h2>

		<p>To search for appropriate datasets, users type in relevant words or phrases (e.g., infant, Smith, language, 12-month-old, 2011). If these words are present in the abstract, manuscript, coding manual, spreadsheets, or other metadata associated with the study, studies, video clips or portions of video clips might be returned.</p> 

		<p>To navigate within datasets and search results, users could browse by relevance, time sample, or event sample.</p> 
	</article>

	<article id="requirements">
		<h2>Do I have to use OpenSHAPA or <a href="http://datavyu.org">Datavyu</a> to contribute?</h2>

		<p>No. Contributors are not required to score their data with the OpenSHAPA coding tool. However, we encourage them to use OpenSHAPA because it is free and open source and every user strengthens and grows the community.</p> 

		<p>We will work towards round trip interoperability between OpenSHAPA and other free or low-cost academic tools (TalkBank, Elan, Transana). We are also aiming to build one-way translation between commercial tools (e.g., Noldus, Mangold) and OpenSHAPA.</p> 
	</article>

	<article id="improve">
		<h2>How will using Datavyu and joining the Databrary improve my science?</h2>

		<p>The Datavyu coding tool, Labnanny management tools, and data and tools in Databrary will help researchers to discover more, faster.</p> 
	</article>

	<article id="sustain">
		<h2>How do we build a sustainable user community?</h2>

		<p>Become a user and/or a contributor of data, tools, and open source code. Share your suggestions and needs with the community by adding comments to the wikis or helping others on the Datavyu support forum.</p>
