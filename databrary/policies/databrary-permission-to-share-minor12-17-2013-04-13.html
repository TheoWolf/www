<h2>Permission to Share Recordings of Minors 12-17 Years of Age</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This form requests permission to include video/audio recordings or still images of you in a secure data library on the Internet (databrary.org). The library allows authorized researchers to share data. Data sharing will help researchers to learn more and will lead to faster progress in our understanding of human development.</p>
<p>Giving permission to share is entirely separate from giving consent to participate in a research study. You do not have to give permission to share your video/audio recordings or still images in the library. Your choice will not affect your receipt of payment if offered for your participation in this or future studies.</p>
<h3>What will be shared?</h3>
<p>With your permission, we will include video/audio recordings or still images of you in the library.</p>
<h3>Will the information be confidential (private)?</h3>
<p>Your information will be kept private. All of your information will be identified by a code number, not by name. No information will be included in the library about how to contact you or your family.</p>
<p>Your image and/or voice may be seen or heard on video/audio recordings or still images. Your name may be spoken aloud. The images and/or voices of visitors or other members of your family may also be seen or heard; if the study takes place in your home, aspects of your home may be seen or heard. Someone might be able to identify you or other people unintentionally. But, the authorized researchers with access to the library promise to keep confidential the identities of all people in the video/audio recordings or still images.</p>
<h3>Who can access information in the library?</h3>
<p>Only authorized researchers have access to information in the library. Researchers who are granted access must sign a contract that requires them to maintain confidentiality (keep information private) and not to use information for commercial purposes. Researchers promise to treat information in the library with the same high standards of care that they treat information collected in their own laboratories.</p>
<h3>How long will information remain in the library?</h3>
<p>Information in the library will be preserved forever in a secure location. We do not intend to erase the information. We intend to store the information so that future researchers may be able to use it.</p>
<p>If in the future you no longer wish to have your video/audio recordings or still images stored in the library, please contact Databrary at <script type="text/javascript">
