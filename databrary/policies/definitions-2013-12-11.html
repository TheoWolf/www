<h4 id="principal-investigator-pi-principal-investigator-pi-status">Principal Investigator (PI), Principal Investigator (PI) Status</h4>
<p>An employee of an <em>Institution</em> who has the background and training in scientific and administrative oversight necessary to conduct and manage a sponsored project. <em>Institutions</em> determine who may have PI status, but the definition typically includes tenure-track faculty (Instructor through Professor, sometimes Emeritus), research or clinical faculty faculty, and may include archivists, curators, and librarians.

<p>Specific rights for sharing and public release granted by <em>Depicted Individuals</em> in a <em>Permission to Share Data</em> document.</p>
<p>Databrary currently supports four (4) levels of <em>Sharing Permission</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>No-sharing (Private)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Databrary may store <em>Recordings</em> or <em>Self-Reported Health-Related Information</em> but not share them beyond the set of <em>Investigators</em> who are part of the <em>Data Contributor</em>’s approved research team under an existing research protocol approved by a <em>Research Supervision Entity</em>. The full responsibility for identifying who constitutes the set of researchers allowed access in this case is the <em>Data Contributor’s</em>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Sharing with Databrary <em>Investigators</em> and <em>Affiliate Investigators</em> (Shared)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Data</em> may be shared with other Databrary <em>Investigators</em> or <em>Affiliate Investigators</em>, but no <em>Recordings</em> or <em>Excerpts</em> may be shown in public.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Sharing and Public Excerpts Permitted (Excerptable)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Data</em> may be shared with other Databrary <em>Investigators</em> or <em>Affiliate Investigators</em>. <em>Excerpts</em> may be selected by an <em>Investigator</em> and may be presented in public settings -— in classrooms, at scientific or technical meetings —- and may be published in the media, in textbooks, scientific publications, or on the Internet as long as no <em>Personally Identifying Information</em> about a <em>Depicted Person</em> is included with the <em>Excerpt</em>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Public</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Data</em>, including recordings, may be shared openly with the <em>Public</em>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="access-permissions-level">Access Permissions (Level)</h4>
<p>Specific permissions placed on a study or other digital object by a Researcher controlling its access by other Databrary users. These are distinct from and may have more flexibility than Sharing Permission.</p>
<h4 id="authorization-userinvestigator-authorization-level">Authorization, User/Investigator Authorization (Level)</h4>
<p>Privileges granted to individuals to access Databrary.</p>
<h4 id="promise-of-confidentiality">Promise of Confidentiality</h4>
<p>A promise to a respondent or <em>Research Participant</em> that the information the respondent provides will not be disseminated without the permission of the respondent; that the fact that the respondent participated in the study will not be disclosed; and that disseminated information will include no linkages to the identity of the respondent. Such a promise encompasses traditional notions of both confidentiality and anonymity. Names and other identifying information regarding respondents, proxies, or other persons on whom the respondent or proxy provides information, are presumed to be confidential.</p>
<h4 id="deductive-disclosure">Deductive Disclosure</h4>
<p>The discerning of an individual's identity or confidential information through the use of known characteristics of that individual. Disclosure risk is present if an unacceptably narrow estimation of an individual’s confidential information is possible or if determining the exact attributes of the individual is possible with a high level of confidence.</p>
<h4 id="public-showing">Public Showing</h4>
<p>Playing an audio or video segment or showing a photograph to an audience that is not limited to <em>Research Staff</em>.</p>
<h4 id="research">Research</h4>
<p>A systematic investigation, including research development, testing and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge. <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html#46.102">45 CFR 46.102(d)</a></p>
<h4 id="non-research-non-research-activities-non-research-scientific-activities">Non-Research, Non-Research Activities, Non-Research Scientific Activities</h4>
<p>Work by <em>Investigators</em> or <em>Affiliate Investigators</em> involving <em>Data</em> that falls outside the scope of <em>Research</em>, but respects research ethics principles.</p>
