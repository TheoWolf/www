# Website modifications

## Site-wide

- ~~Increase font size site-wide?~~
-
## [Databrary.org](http://databrary.org)

### Site-wide footer

~~- Funding source with NSF logo and grant number (BCS 1238599) on each page (footer?)~~
 >Not sure this is site-wide. I see the footer in the datavyu.org pages, but not on staging.databrary.org. Probably just replicate the footer or 

- Add Funding page when we have more funding sources

### Join our mailing list tab

~~Window persists after hitting subscribe button.~~

### Fix mailing list output

On MailChimp, fix Testing mail confirmation / switch to a real list before site goes live.


### [Databrary.org/about/#community](http://staging.databrary.org/about/#community)

Add links to every advisory board and committed contributor. ~~Can't find the html on github, but it was on the old databrary repo.~~found! 

## [Datavyu.org](http://datavyu.org)

### Site-wide nav bar

#### Developer tab

- Should we alert that we are leaving the site? (Requires more unnecessary clicks?)

> True, more clicks. Could we have a mouse-over/pop-up or is that bad UI style?

### Site-wide footer

- ~~Funding source with NSF logo and grant number (BCS 1238599) on each page (footer?)~~

- (Have included grant # for now, when more funding sources include only logos of funding agencies.)

- Check social media links: should we have "Follow" links instead? (I'm personally wary about automatic follows and likes, so maybe no?)  

### [features.html](http://datavyu.org/features.html)

- Replace monkeybars video for "Record Observations" with something that is less "motor" (video taken yesterday. will sync and edit later this week)

### [support.html](http://datavyu.org/support.html)

- Complete refactor to Datavyu
	- ~~Change "Help others by asking and answering OpenSHAPA questions." in **welcome to Datavyu Support** box~~
	- ~~Change to About Datavyu in blue right hand side bar.~~
	 	
### [datavyu.org/bugs](http://datavyu.org/bugs/)

- Link takes to log-in page (offering Bugzilla alongside the support forum, both with separate logins, might be confusing to the general public. How about a link nested somewhere in the github repository for developers?)
- Customize to reflect datavyu?


## [Labnanny.org](http://labnanny.org)

### Links.html?

Should we add a links.html page with links to other lab/data management solutions like [Open Science Framework](http://openscienceframework.org/)
Agreed. Can someone provide a list of these links?

### Site-wide footer

- Funding source with NSF logo and grant number (BCS 1238599) on each page (footer?)

- Plan for addition of NICHD and possibly other funding sources.
