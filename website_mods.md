# Website modifications

## Site-wide

- ~~Increase font size site-wide?~~
- databrary.com does not point to www.databrary.org site.
  Yes, it does:
    databrary.com is an alias for databrary.org.
  foo.databrary.com doesn't but blame name.com for that.

## [Databrary.org](http://databrary.org)

### Site-wide footer
- We need a databrary-specific footer.
	- ~~Facebook icon links to datavyu, not databrary FB page. Correct URL is https://www.facebook.com/pages/Databrary/185349568273416~~
	- ~~Google+ icond links to @datavyu, not @databrary. Correct URL is https://plus.google.com/u/1/111083162045777800330/posts~~ 
	- ~~GitHub icon links to http://github.com/databrary/datavyu; Correct URL is http://github.com/databrary~~
	- Twitter icon link is correct.
	- Fix URLs to Jobs and Contact to databrary.org/jobs/ and databrary.org/contact from staging*

- Add Funding page when we have more funding sources

### [Databrary.org/about/#community](http://staging.databrary.org/about/#community)

Add links to every advisory board and committed contributor. at openshapa/openshare gh-pages 

### [Databrary.org/contact/](http://staging.databrary.org/contact/)

## [Datavyu.org](http://datavyu.org)

### Site-wide nav bar

#### Developer tab
	 	
## [Labnanny.org](http://labnanny.org)

### Links.html?

Should we add a links.html page with links to other lab/data management solutions like [Open Science Framework](http://openscienceframework.org/)
Agreed. Can someone provide a list of these links?

### Site-wide footer

- Funding source with NSF logo and grant number (BCS 1238599) on each page (footer?)

- Plan for addition of NICHD and possibly other funding sources.
