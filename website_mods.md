# Website modifications

## Site-wide

- databrary.com does not point to www.databrary.org site.
  Yes, it does:
    databrary.com is an alias for databrary.org.
  foo.databrary.com doesn't but blame name.com for that.

## [Databrary.org](http://databrary.org)

### Site-wide footer

- Add Funding page when we have more funding sources

### [Databrary.org/about/#community](http://staging.databrary.org/about/#community)

Add links to every advisory board and committed contributor. at openshapa/openshare gh-pages

## [Datavyu.org](http://datavyu.org)

### Site-wide nav bar

#### Developer tab
	 	
## [Labnanny.org](http://labnanny.org)

### Links.html?

Should we add a links.html page with links to other lab/data management solutions like [Open Science Framework](http://openscienceframework.org/)
The list comes across as a hodgepodge without descriptions of each. Could probably use some pruning too since we aren't endorsing, say, Mendeley per se. I think this should wait until later.
> [Here](https://github.com/databrary/www/edit/master/links.html) is a start based on our @databrary Twitter subscriptions.

### Site-wide footer

- Funding source with NSF logo and grant number (BCS 1238599) on each page (footer?)

- Plan for addition of NICHD and possibly other funding sources.
