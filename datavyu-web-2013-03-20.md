### Datavyu

Required before Datavyu 1.0 launch:

- A week of pounding is needed before we can launch. NYU is on spring break so Karen's lab has not had the chance to do this yet. This is crucial for discovering errors that neither Kasey nor Gladys could find.

- Kasey is writing a user manual. Should be ready by next week.

- Jesse is working on scripting fix. He says most of scripting should be working, and he put in additional smaller bug fixes. The reliability checking script is working.

- Datavyu 1.0 will be launched with QuickTime as the default, with the option to choose VLC as the secondary video player. However, QT has a problem in that it plays at 30 fps. This poses a problem because some videos play at 25 fps. Jesse (and Eric) will discuss plan for longer term solution.

- have a list of features we want for the next version before our release.

### Website

- already online out of staging

- We will have visitor analytics to track users to the website. Dylan is working on this.

- Go through website to check text for errors. Amy is working on this.

- Match committed contributor list to list on MailChimp. Convert announcement to HTML, put into template for MailChimp. Amy is doing this.

- put edits in [website_mods.md](https://github.com/databrary/www/blob/master/website_mods.md)


### Next week

- Discuss results of Datavyu testing.

- Review Kasey's draft user manual.

- Review Datayvu announcement text.
