Title: Download Datavyu
Brief: Download
Order: 2000

# Current Status

The Datavyu coding tool is free academic software. 
Based on our internal testing, we recommend the following environments for using Datavyu:

Windows 7

Mac OS X 10.10.3 Yosemite or earlier

Other operating environments have not been tested fully and may not work. 
For those who wish to run Datavyu in an unsupported/untested environment, we recommend in-depth testing to ensure that Datavyu plays videos properly prior to using it for research. 
We also recommend that users do not upgrade computers or software in the middle of coding a study with Datavyu.

We are available to provide help and guidance in the use of Datavyu in supported environments, but may not be able to deliver fixes for unsupported/untested environments.

# Older Releases

Most people should use the latest stable release, but you can also download [older releases](/releases/) or [unstable versions](/releases_pre/).

# Tools

We suggest coding with an extended keyboard or a USB numpad to take advantage of Datavyu's Data Viewer Controller.
The Controller maps onto the numpad and allows users to navigate swiftly and easily through a data source. 

Please feel free to use our [coding example](/user-guide/_downloads/DatavyuSample.zip) to practice coding with a sample video and corresponding spreadsheet.
See how to observe specific behaviors and mark them in Datavyu.

Attention Windows users: Please pay careful attention to the Quicktime [software requirements](/user-guide/guide/install.html#software-requirements) detailed in the [User Guide](/user-guide/guide.html).
