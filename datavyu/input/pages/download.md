Title: Download Datavyu
Brief: Download
Order: 2000

# Current Status

The Datavyu coding tool is academic software that has been successfully used by a number of labs over the years but is no longer being actively updated to address changes in other software packages and operating systems. 
Most of the issues we encounter are related to video playback, caused by new releases in QuickTime, OS X, and Windows.

As such, we recommend that new users do in-depth testing in their environment to ensure that datavyu plays videos properly prior to using it for research.
If you have an existing workflow, we recommend that you do not upgrade your computer or software while you are in the middle of coding a study with Datavyu.

We are available to continue providing help and guidance but may not be able to promise major fixes in the near term.

# Older Releases

Most people should use the latest stable release, but you can also download [older releases](/releases/) or [unstable versions](/releases_pre/).

# Tools

We suggest coding with an extended keyboard or a USB numpad to take advantage of Datavyu's Data Viewer Controller.
The Controller maps onto the numpad and allows users to navigate swiftly and easily through a data source. 

Please feel free to use our [coding example](/user-guide/_downloads/DatavyuSample.zip) to practice coding with a sample video and corresponding spreadsheet.
See how to observe specific behaviors and mark them in Datavyu.

Attention Windows users: Please pay careful attention to the Quicktime [software requirements](/user-guide/guide/install.html#software-requirements) detailed in the [User Guide](/user-guide/guide.html).
