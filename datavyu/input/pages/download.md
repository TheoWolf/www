# Older Releases

Most people should use the latest stable release, but you can also download [older releases](/releases/) or [unstable versions](/releases_pre/).

# Tools

We suggest coding with an extended keyboard or a USB numpad to take advantage of Datavyu's Data Viewer Controller.
The Controller maps onto the numpad and allows users to navigate swiftly and easily through a data source. 

Please feel free to use our [coding example](/user-guide/_downloads/DatavyuSample.zip) to practice coding with a sample video and corresponding spreadsheet.
See how to observe specific behaviors and mark them in Datavyu.

# Plugins

You will soon be able to install additional plugins to customize Datavyu and make it yours. Stay tuned for greater functionality that addresses your different needs!

Attention Windows users: Please pay careful attention to the Quicktime [software requirements](/user-guide/guide/install.html#software-requirements) detailed in the [User Guide](/user-guide/guide.html).
