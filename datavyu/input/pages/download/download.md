# Older Releases

Most people should use the latest stable release, but you can also download [older releases](/releases/) or [unstable versions](/releases_pre/).

# Tools

We suggest coding with a keyboard or a USB keypad to take advantage of Datavyu's Data Viewer Controller. The Controller
maps onto the keyboard and allows users to navigate swiftly and easily through a data source. 

# Plugins

You will soon be able to install additional plugins to customize Datavyu and make it yours. Stay tuned for greater functionality that addresses your different needs!

Attention Windows users: Please pay careful attention to the Quicktime [software requirements](/user-guide/guide/install.html#software-requirements) detailed in the [User Guide](/user-guide/guide.html).
