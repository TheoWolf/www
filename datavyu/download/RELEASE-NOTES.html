<h3 id="section">12/11/2013</h3>
<h4 id="additions">Additions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Added file association support in Mac and Windows. Double-clicking on a .opf file will now open the file in Datavyu.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="changes">Changes</h4>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Variables&quot; have been renamed &quot;columns&quot; and &quot;matrix arguments&quot; have been renamed &quot;codes&quot; throughout the user interface.</li>
<li>All API functions have been renamed to use the words &quot;column&quot; and &quot;code&quot;, however, API functions using the old naming scheme will continue to work so that scripts do not need to be revised.</li>
<li>Scripts now allow the user to overwrite an existing column. Previously, trying to set a column back to the spreadsheet caused an error if the columns shared the same name.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue with Datavyu failing to close completely (preventing the user from being able to reopen the program).</li>
<li>Corrected a case where setting the offset of a cell changed the offset of the previous cell in a column</li>
<li>Fixed the create_mutually_exclusive script to correct an error where the final cell was not written to the spreadsheet.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that was preventing output from being written to the scripting console.</li>
<li>Improved video playback performance issues on Windows and Mac.</li>
<li>Fixed some cases where cells failed to display correctly when temporal ordering is active.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="known-issues">Known Issues</h4>
<ul>
<li>In some cases, the asterisk in the title bar indicating that changes have been made to the file may not appear/disappear correctly</li>
<li>Hidden variables may be listed as shown in the variable list</li>
<li>Temporal ordering displays cells incorrectly in rare cases</li>
<li>Windows will not correctly handle opening a file by double clicking it once Datavyu is already open.</li>
</ul>
